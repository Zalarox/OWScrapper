Welcome to Season 6 of Competitive Play
It's all fun and games until you get 2cp twice in a row
I've already had my first thrower.
So hyped. I ended at at 2555 last leason, with a career high of 2735. My friend ended at 2982, his career high. We did placements right away and won 2, lost 1, and won 7. I placed at 2845, already my career high, and he at 3210! I think the changes to placements really do make a difference!
ended season at 4033 with a high of 4152. went 7-3 in placements and landed at 4153.

lul
For your own sake, don't get hyped and instead wait a few days before starting your placements. It's always the same chaos at the beginning of every new season and it's no fun to have unbalanced matches
Sitting at about like 1100 right now. I started 2200 in season 3 or 4 and just ran that rating into the ground. Should I even bother with trying to bring it back up? It's so abysmally low that I hardly even play competitive
I liked best of five better than best of three. It gave us a chance to get our shit together and make a comeback. 
I'm so ready to give up on competitive. I got placed at 1855 and I'm almost all the way down to 1100. It's the same reason I pretty much gave up last season: no one wants to communicate, people throw on purpose or leave if they waste their ult once. I don't see the point in trying to improve if I'm consistently losing for reasons out of my control.
Is it me? Or is Bronze/Silvers/Golds mixed in the same games?  
I don't know, Skill-wise I thought I was in Bronze games.
Is it just me or after 2am EST people start playing comp like it's QP? 
Can't wait to see people instalocking Mercy and never even taking the staff out this mid-season.
If someone could give me some tips to get out of silver I will be extremely grateful. I am a flex player and I am not toxic. Just tell me how I should play when my team has two 0 dmg dealing carries say hanzo and widow. I have tried being the healer and also the tank, I don't know how to play around a 0 accuracy widow and /or hanzo. So should I just dps? 
Played all 10 placement matches as a 6-stack in one session. Our starting average SR was around 2600. We managed to win 8, draw 1 and lose 1 game. In the  end our average SR was at 2850, with 2 of us at career high rating. 
In two matches we had a 4-stack + 2-stack (one of those games was the only defeat), all other were 6v6. 


Last season, I started in bronze in the 800's. I ended up in silver in the low 1500's. I didn't realized how much I climbed. This season, ended up in silver. I'm going to climb to gold. 
Came within 12 SR of silver. Then, a 300 point slide featuring eight straight games where someone left.   Bronze is a goddamned prison. 
In the past 10 games of comp I've played, I've had leavers in 8 of them, 7 on my team and one on the enemy team. Is this just going to happen nonstop in silver? I'm starting to wonder if it's even worth playing comp because it's so demoralizing to constantly lose because people can't handle staying for the whole game. Is it always like this or am I just getting really unlucky? it's my first time playing comp since season 2 and I really don't remember it being like this :(
X-post from the megathread in /r/overwatch:

This new comp season feels completely fucked compared to last season.
Last season, I think I won about 6 of my 10 placement matches. I topped out at about CP 3600 or something.

This season, I lost all but 1 of my placements. Got placed at 3100, and in the space of two days have tanked down to 2800. Objectively, I've been absolutely playing my ass off and literally lost like 8 games in a row yesterday alone.

I'm not the greatest player, but I know that I've personally improved a significant amount since last comp season (especially the beginning). Despite that, most of my losses have been complete one-sided stomps.

So yeah I'm not sure if this just shitty luck or what, but something feels very 'off' with this comp season for me personally.
4300 last season and 4 out of 10 games I had players that barely finished DIAMOND last season. Even after placement I was getting players on my team that were legitimately 1300 Elo lower than me. -35 a game because I was supposed to carry dead weight. Not impressed at all so far. 
Did they change something about the Placement-Games? I always placed around midgold and now I'm Plat after my placement which were 5-5.

Well I'm happy because I barely made it last season to plat, so I'm a bit surprised.

If the enemy quits, or if you don't get many medals, will that affect your final score? I have done well as Orisa, Doomfist and Winston so far but none of them get many medals at all.
If someone could give me some tips to get out of silver I will be extremely grateful. I am a flex player and I am not toxic. Just tell me how I should play when my team has two 0 dmg dealing carries say hanzo and widow. I have tried being the healer and also the tank, I don't know how to play around a 0 accuracy widow and /or hanzo. So should I just dps? 
Doing my placements and then this shit happens https://imgur.com/gallery/0pM69

Fuck me, right?
Having fun this season but 2cp
I just won my first placement match and it was the first time I used my mic to communicate. I'm on PS4, so mics are rare (although I have seen a lot more lately), so there was only one other person talking. But I actually tried to make call outs and lead the team. I'm pretty sure most of the other teammates were at least listening. We had a reaper that kept flanking the enemy and kept dying, and I asked him to stay grouped up with us since they kept trying to dive with a D. va and a roadhog, and that helped a ton. I also just kept emphasizing that we need to stay grouped up because me (Zenyatta) can't heal when the reaper and d. Va are pushing too far forward. It worked, and after losing the first round, we won the next two. I know it's just one placement match but that was the most fun I've had in Overwatch in a long time.
I actually won 7 placement matches as mercy, how am I only 1526 in SR?
Strange, did 5/5 for placements. Ended last season with 2862 (also season high since it's my second account where I mostly just play placement matches) and I started at 3401 o_O
I had one account finish at 2200 and place at 2250, but I have another account that's plat, unfinished placements. Should I be at 2250, was I carried? ): 
When someone leaves a game, what should you report them for? It doesn't look like that is one of the categories.
Dropped 200 SR over the weekend and I was 140 from ranking up.  I play mainly to have fun with my squad, but losing a lot is not fun.  When our squad of 3 gets in a rut we go to Arcades and play 3v3 and now 4v4 deathmatch to pick up our spirits.  We win a lot in the arcades btw which helps us get our confidence in our own squad abilities up.  What does your squad do when you're on a losing streak?
Really strange season so far, placed 800 in S3 climbed to 2000 dropped to 1500, 1500 in S4, ended in 1600 but barely played, went 9wins-1loss in S5 and placed in 1700, sitting at 2100 now with 70% winrate over 10 hours. Always considered myself a solid mid silver player since I placed at 26 in S1, I feel extremely boosted. Are there smurfs in low gold? Always thought smurfs would be prevalent in bronze or diamond. 
Anyone know if pre-season/off-season affects mmr?  I had a few bad games where I performed well but my team just wasn't carrying their weight and lost a few games.  I ended up placing below my season high of around 1600 sr.  It seems like no matter how well you perform in the new season mmr seems to really affect your overall sr. 

Granted I am still relatively new to overwatch but I feel like I have improved dramatically since then and have been finding myself placed with a lot of players that are at a lower skill level in terms of performance
Has anyone got any tips for roadhog in this new season ? 
last season i stopped at 2609. after my placements (8 wins 2 draws) i placed at 2603. heLLo? jEFf kaPLAn??? i think i was doing pretty good as dva, on fire, medals, etc 

on top of that, after every loss i lose around 50 SR, a win would get me around 20 SR. yikes man. what am i doing wrong. 
I'm one tricking mei this season. As long as we have at least one tank and at least one healer and we have a hard counter to their pharah I'm sticking to her. It's my turn to play dps this season. 
Hey pplz.

I would like to share my experiences with season 6 so far. Last season I ended on 2492 and decided to do placements with my friends with whom I usually play
All 6 of us came together and played all 10 placements from the same room. It was super fun and we ended with a score of 8-1-1. Had some excellent games against excellent 6-stacks along the way.
We got placed about 200 SR higher than we ended Season 5. I was placed at 2727, which is my career high.
And this is where the shitstorm starts.

After a couple of days I decided to play some solo queue comp. I play tank and support roles and really love to play as a team. However, I couldn't get and communication going from my teammates throughout the period of 3 days that I played solo. I would say Hello, wrote my best heroes, asked everyone (politely ofc) to join team voice, communicated callouts in a polite, calm manner, but my teams were complete and utter shite that would mostly fall apart somewhere in the middle of a match. At that time I thought I was a BAD player and that I deserve to lose. However, when my friends started playing solo, 2 or 3 stack, they reported the same thing: games that feel are out of their hands.

By playing as a 6- stack, we cheated Jeff's retarded hidden MMR and are now being punished for it. That's at least what I think.

Anyone else had a similar experience?
If there was a control only competitive queue I'd never queue into anything else.
Ever since I started playing Sombra i've been excited to play 2cp. 
What maps though. I genuinely enjoy Hanamura and the Lunar whatever. Temple of Anubis and Volyaska can suck a fat dick.
They tweaked defensive respawn times for 2cp again.  It the mode feels better to play I'll know why.
I live for 2CP.  Attacking sucks when you can't come up with a good attack plan, but I love defense so much.
Sombra main, went fine.
It's like the first robin of spring!!
I have already had 4 people quit in my first placement match.....  Great start to the season -.-
Time to test the new report? 
I had a lot of salt in my placements matches so far. I insta-locked widow and it tilted the fuck out of my team even when we were still in spawn. Then it was all about a stagger fest and them telling how much I suck after less than 4 minutes of widow. I love when people underperform so hard that they have to blame it on anyone but themself. 
On average your friend gained/lost 28.5 per match. You gained/lost 36.25 per match. That sounds about normal, no?
My season high was 3147 last season and I ended the season at 3000 (decay).  I placed this season at 3159 after going 4-5-1 and am now over 3200.
Sounds exactly right if you calculate about ~30 loss/gain per match.

Honestly I feel like re-placement is just continuation of your previous skill rating in "hidden" mode for 10 matches.
Already played 6/10, what are you talking about? Everything seems to be fine. And I'm honestly surprised how close my allie's season 5 SR to mine since it's night in eu, and I don't really think too many people are playing now
I lost 7/10 and placed mid diamond (3223). 
Hidden rating does not get reset between seasons meaning you'll still be matched with people similar to your skill. The only difference would be people switching the characters they want to play in a new season.
This is all in your head.  Actual hidden rating used to make games doesn't change between seasons, just SR display.
Wish I had listened to this, dropped from high plat to mid gold by losing 9 games....
If there's one good thing to come out of how disappointing season 5 was, I'm at the point where I have no problem waiting a week or two to jump back into the Competitive. I've always only been able to hold off for a day or two, but now I'm taking my sweet ass time till all the one tricks and quitters get put in their respective places. 


Death match has been a good change of pace. 
Yeah we have a six stack that went in last night because we were excited and we got absolutely wrecked 4 games in a row. I finally realized that we should probably wait until things calm down in about a week or so. We played Seven quick playing matches together after that and dominated on every one but on those competitive matches none of us are above level 200 and there was one match where we were against a team of six people all above level 500. I know your level doesn't necessarily indicate your skill level but holy shit. Matchmaking is ridiculous right now do not go in there
I finished high silver last season, and most of my team a couple games ago said they finished silver or low gold. Seems fine to me.
Lost 9 and one 1 and only ended up 62 SR below what I finished at in season 5. 

Much balance, such wow
If you still enjoy playing competitive matches, why not? Give it a go, see if you can better yourself and your SR.
You should be able to carry at bronze, it'll be an easy climb.
How hard can it be to climb out of bronze? 
Yes! Do it. I did it the other way around, did horrible in my first 10 placements, literally 0-10 in season 3. Started at 1100... dropped to like 800. Now I'm at 2281 with 67%WR, exclusively solo queueing.
As good as it feels to take that 3-2 it feels substantially worse to take the 2-3
You still have that chance

Don't worry about your rank, just play for fun. If you're playing above your rank it will average out and you will climb. The "its my team thats holding me back" mentality is terrible because the 11 other players in your game are all being pulled from the same pool of players. The game doesn't say "oh there will be 6 good players against NotAToyota, and he'll have 5 bad ones to even it out" it just pulls 11 bronze players and puts them in the game with you. Sometimes you get throwers, sometimes the enemy gets throwers. It balances out. Just mute people (because people in bronze aren't going to make good callouts anyway, its just toxicity) and when you get to gold, start communicating again. Trust me, if you play well, you will rise. Good luck :)
Progress update: I've tried focusing on getting really good in QP with 2 heroes in each category: Pharah, Soldier, Junkrat, Mei, D VA, Winston, Ana and Zenyatta. I have fairly good accuracy with them all (ranging from about 55-65% which is well beyond the average player this low.) 

And...I've gone down. In my last 20 comp games, I have won exactly 1, and got 1 draw. And surprise surprise, it doesn't fucking matter how well I play. I still have people leave immediately after the enemy team gets an advantage. I get icewalled by my team's Mei on purpose, no one heals no matter how much I call for it, and no one wants to communicate . I've dropped to almost 700 SR. I'm done, I think with the game in general. I've had my fun, but if trying to improve only brings me farther down, I don't see the point. Thanks for nothing.

Nothing good happens after 2 am, remember?

Joke aside, I've got the contrary. After 2 am the game is just full of smurfs and its ABYSMAL.
After midnight PST, I can't make myself get off but I play 100% tilted.

I'm not proud of it, but it's such an addiction, every game ends and nothing in the world feels more important than getting back in there and winning the next goddam game.

I dropped over 1000 SR in a single night that way in S5 (the first season I played)... but frankly, I'm actually where I belong now in mid-bronze. Still not sure how the hell I placed into Gold, other than playing nothing but support and getting matched with teams who protected their support.

But yeah, I imagine the people who are responsible and in control of their emotions/lives probably mostly get off before I do and get some rest.
The gun in Valkyrie got nerfed.
Check a guide on sensitivity and DPI (it's important trust me.) I guess you're on PC? Anyways. 

You should play the role which you are most competent with. If you're going healer and just sit in a corner looking cool you wont accomplish much, if you play Reinhardt and dig a trench on attack you wont accomplish much either.

Pick more all around supports/tanks, Zen great support you get discord and when you learn how to aim you shoot down pharahs from left to right, Zarya is a great can be in the thick of the fight and have the potential to save people. 

Pick what YOU think will have the most impact in both fucking over their team and helping yours. Also try to be more aggressive put on some metal and butcher everything. Stop trying to focus on your own teammates seriously getting pissed off on some idiots you will have to spend ten minutes of your life with will be a waste of time. Accept the loses and learn from them.

Also try a bit of Reinhardt on attack payload, great hero to learn when not to go in and when to hammer everything in your field of view. (Don't hold on to your ult for that perfect moment use them. It's better to FAIL in an ult and learn from it then only using it once per twenty games) Your job as a tank is to create opportunities for your DPS players. (called creating "space" in OW terms i think check it up)
Good luck! Been there, the grind was difficult, and I'm aiming towards Platinum myself now :)
I had 6 leavers in a row lol... I don't think I belong in high elo because I'm bad but I don't think I deserve this level of suffering either
It might be due to server issues, I had a couple of games two days ago where people were consistently leaving and the map was switching (from Dorado to Lunar Horizon Colony, Route 66 to Ilios.) Was strange as hell. But otherwise, the time of day you're playing matters, try different queue timings, and try to befriend as many random people as possible and group queue to minimize the chance of throwers in your team. 
I was getting something simillar. I ended season 5 at 3094 and I've played 4 placement games so far and I think I've only seen one person who wasn't master at the end of the last season. Unless my hidden mmr went up through my 7 game win streak or my off season quick play games I don't know why I'm playing with masters (though it is quite fun to play with people that are better than me).
Maybe there weren't many people on in yiur bracjet, or you had at least somewhat closer mmr than sr.
Could be decayed accounts
Yes they did. Before, they used to put you at a lower level than you were so you could feel good about moving up. Now they place you at the level you should be.
If you don't want to play, then don't play. There's nothing wrong with the other modes.
I feel ya, PS4 players rarely use voice chat but at least you guys managed to win. Want to play comp sometime? PSN TsundereCactus56
I've been doing poor teamwork.  Leaving to me is giving up on the team.  
Truth. Super bummed they switched back to best of 3. 

Honestly what the fuck?
Had a leaver in the first minute of my match both times i got temple of anubis during placements. So sad :( 

Fellow sombra main.
I think you're the only person I've seen on any Overwatch subreddit who actually likes Hanamura. XD
Yes. But before, you were pretty much guaranteed to place a 100 or 200 below your last season SR to give you a feeling if success when you climb right at the start. They removed this.

Also, I saw another guy who lost 9 and won 1, and he placed 62 below. So that is kind if weird.
Yeah this season feels like we will hide your sr for 10 games then give you a number where you would've been if you played these 10 games at the end of last season
Ended last season at 2061. Went 3-7 in my placements and got 2052. 

Maybe my rank has more inertia because the game has 5 seasons of stats for me?
Idk, my first two games were awful. First one everyone else on my team was much lower ranked and I barely squeezed out a draw. Second one everyone was 500 sr higher and although we won, I couldn't do shit for the team. 
I'm pretty sure I played a match last night where the enemy team completed the 2CP map in like 2 minutes. I had a few close matches, but most were very lopsided. 
We got horribly matched with people who had much higher SR than all of us. We have a team of six people but we are all real life friends and four of the people have never played competitive before so matching us against plat and diamond players was not awesome 
I won 9 and lost 1 (you spelled won one by the way), and I placed at my career high, which was just under 300sr ABOVE my ending last season. It is different for everybody dude.
If I remember well, losses and victories don't matter in your placement matches. It's only important once you got your SR.
Yeah placements are a joke 
I don't think I really enjoy the grind that much. Especially at that rank. Last season I felt like I shouldn't have even done placements because ppl will make fun of me for how low it is in qp or arcade games. "How are you even 1100?" Idk feelsbadman 
I played a few Comp games on my buddy's 1200sr account. Got it out of bronze without much effort, and I'm only in plat. If you are better than bronze, you'll get out. They usually make a lot of mistakes that can be punished. 
I don't know. I've yet to really see any climbing. I climbed out of gold a couple seasons ago on the ps4 but idk the pc account just seems too low to revive.
Its hard when you are on defence with 5 idiots that all try to attack the enemy spawn and, wonder why they die (enemy has infininte health in spawn and zero walk back time) and then they all have the long walk back and the payload by this time has made half its journey. 

You cannot carry 5 complete idiots that insist on attacking spawn.
IDK dawg I've been here for three seasons.
I've been stuck between 1400-1480 for a long time now. I'm not sure what to do. I think part of the problem is that I hardly play offense or defense because people instalock those, so I end up filling with tank or support.
Yeeaah I guess you're right...
It can be difficult to get six strangers who will never meet irl to work together, especially when half of them don't talk. I liked having an extra round to pull it together. My favorite games were the long ones where we made a comeback from 0-2. I understand that it made the matches long and unenjoyable for some people though. 
But it's not fun, that's the whole reason I'm so ready to leave. When I get gold eliminations as Lucio every game, what's even the point? And I don't need to mute because no one talks, they just get quietly toxic and throw. I just played a game where we lost round one on Hanamura and my ENTIRE TEAM left. It's barely even a game this low, and I'm sick of it. I know there's an equal chance for the enemy team to get a team this bad, but I have yet to see it.
Thanks Bot!
So did her flight speed and everything else that was amazing about her on the PTR. RIP good Mercy. 
Good riddance. There's no reason Mercy should be able to frag out like that. She's the purest healer in the game and should stay that way.
Ya i main mcree and I have been told that I can use him till high Plat as I am now. I have read about all them mouse settings too. Regardless thanks for the advice. I am pretty much experienced at this game from a game sense perspective since I am at my 5th prestige. Been watching stylosa, my overwatch and overwatch central. I try to incorporate all that they say into my game play.

The problem I am having now is that even though I can cree very well I have to give up dps to other players since they lock in. Even if a lock in before and politely ask them to consider giving me dps they ignore me. Hence I fill what I think is most appropriate for the team. Eg- lacking healer need tank I usually go hog or zarya. Need main tank against pharah I go dva. Need a burst heal and I have genji so I go ana. Playing a full dive I go zenyatta. But what should I pick when my damage dealers are a widow, hanzo and a torb.

I would be really grateful if you could give some tips. I have tried playing the usual rein and or dva etc just doesn't work cuz they don't get consistent picks and shoot rein shields.
Should I play a more aggressive tank like zarya or hog? I try but I just fail to clear chokes all by myself.. Maybe I am doing something wrong...

Any tips on the above would be really appreciated
Thanks for your previous advice. 
Thanks! Congrats on Platinum!
I'm sure it's a great learning experience! Just super frustrating for me as an individual. 
Don't think a season high of 3200 is decayed. 
Hell yeah man. I'll add you soon, or you can add me (Cashmerelogan8). What heroes do you main/prefer?
I'm glad. Rolling the dice for "will this be a 10 minute game or a 45 minute brawl?" was always a bummer.
I am not.
It feels less competitive to me, are they going to do this in OWL?
Does it count if I like defending on Hanamura B? :P
I love Hanamura but to be fair, I'm Bronze.
Got placed higher them ended s5. Only one game we had a guy with dcs, but they had their leaver too. So damn balanced lol
Same here man. I just played my first two games and there was zero communication except from me. My first game I solo tanked, but I could have played better. However, in my second game I played Tracer, a dps I have grown to like and I had 3 golds in dmg, elims, and obj kills. I feel as if there was nothing else I could do. Had one healer the whole game until the last minute.
Just had some rough games. One game the team refused to play tank or join voicechat. Their Ana, Soldier, Genji, and Widow all blew.
SR != MMR.

SR decays, MMR doesn't. When the SR difference between teams is big, there's usually one or more people on the lower rated team that have massively decayed.
That sounds like one of your group had a fairly high MMR, even if they had no experience in comp. The shift from QP to comp is very abrupt, but they might place fairly high if they honed what they already know a bit.
I went from 1100 to 2444 last season.  Just play.
How much effort are you putting into it?  Like are you just getting your 10 placements in and calling it good or what?
If you're really good with one of the offense/defense heroes what worked for me was telling people I'm really really good at them and they'd usually let me play them. You probably dont need anymore than 1 tank and 1 mercy at our SR tbh, you could do fine with just that
Ill never understand how people didn't like best of 5... Control maps are the only maps I enjoy playing in this game. I hate 2 CP. Now that its best of 3 it just goes by too quick. Wish they'd allow u to que only in certain maps that'd be fun as hell. Would never leave contorl maps.
Lucio is tough to carry out with. If you want to play support, mercy is great because you can easily fix your teammates mistakes. DPS is great too because just a couple of kills on healers can give your team a huge advantage. High impact flankers are really good for this.
I almost want to say, get a second account and see if your placements put you into Silver or Gold, so you can go from there. 
What should she do?  Every hero has to be worth their slot on the team.  Ana has 300 effective HP, can outheal Mercy, snipe the enemy, peel for herself, and negate all enemy healing on a 10 second cooldown.  Before, Mercy was worth the slot because she could pretty reliably cancel Grav+Nano-blade.  Now all she can do is negate a lucky scatter arrow every 30 seconds.
When you get a torb on attack you pray. Remember this, OW is a team game the people in your rating is on average the same skill level as you etc. The trick is to progressively do better and better, every moment you feel "stuck" in your rank try to figure out what your doing wrong. Keep this mindset for ANY game out there, every single person who plays OW does something wrong every single game so don't ever feel bad for it. The trick is to KNOW when you did something wrong. Question EVERY death you have!  

When it comes to picking DPS it's kinda hard the majority of people loves this role, you can ask for the role if two others already picked it (BUT don't be a dick about it) if no one answers you just fill in. It's a team game help the idiots secure a win. (Ana is quite difficult to play, generally in my experience you can pick Zen and get a better deal out of it so pick Zen more) 

The trick with chokes is to not stand still in them, generally in lower rating people are passive. If you play Reinhardt remember you gain ult charge extremely quickly and everyone pretty much stands on the same spot. Firestrike into them hammer a bit in the choke and you got Earthshatter ready. You shouldn't stay in the choke for to long the enemy also builds up ult charges, when your ult is ready use it and rush in (if you or anyone else manages to secure a kill just yell at em to get in) tell them on the mic. Give feedback on your shield status if the enemy have a pesky widow or something dangerous. 

If they have a Rein try to keep track on when he gets his ult, (boils down to experience Reinhardt is kinda like a mind game and i would say that playing him helps you all around).

There is times when to be defensive and to be aggressive in OW. Even on Defense you should generally be aggressive don't give the enemy a breathing room. (Hog, Dva and Zarya are off tanks they work quite well with a Rein or a Winston which are both main tanks. Orisa doesn't exist so we ignore her ^^!)

Check out "OneAmongstMany" a youtuber/streamer who makes coaching videos generally for lower ratings and he touches a lot on the fundamentals.  Sorry if this is a rambling mix, but sleep is for the weak and my brain is on fire. If you ever get a torb, hanzo and a widow on your team pick something that can help them. It's situational pick what you think will HELP them. 
I may be part of the problem for placements, masters six stacking with silvers isn't great for matchmaking. But it is the only time I can play comp with my friends.
tbf my placements place me in diamond and i don't play more than my placements and maybe 1 or 2 matches. My buddy who got to GM easily says i'm better than him in most aspects (healing, tanking, counterpicking. While he is better at dps)
I agree, best of 3 is great. if it's a tight game it will go 3 rounds, if we  are being rolled or vice versa, then it will be over faster.
I mean, what is literally every payload/double cap map to you then?
It's always been best of three in pro games afaik
Feels way less competitive.
Yeah I've played 15 matches over my 2 accounts and I only had a few that were TOTAL landslides. It seems like they may have improved the match maker silently. 
>I just played my first two games and there was zero communication except from me

Not saying this was you, but my rapidly growing pet peeve is people who only communicate to complain about the lack of communication, but never say anything specific about strategy.
we actually had 3 with previous SR scores, one mid gold, one high gold, and one low plat. I know that losing your placements isn't necessarily a bad thing but it really took the wind out of us. We decided to build some team synergy and did 7 QP matches in a row and decimated the other team in all of them, so we're not like bad - just not as good as the teams we're matching in comp
I'm playing comp a couple times a week, at least one match per session; season 4 I got 20 hours just on Reinhardt but definitely not as much as some people.
I like control and payload a lot. Hybrid is difficult because people usually need to swap after capping the point, but they typically don't, and 2 CP is of the devil because of spawn locations and overtime stalling. 

I wish we could choose what type of map we could queue into, but people would probably find a way to exploit it and get lots of SR quickly. I kinda want the system from TF2 where you can vote on two maps but I'm not sure if it would be possible to implement with the type of game Overwatch is.
Lucio was just an example of the point I'm trying to make. DPS is always useless, and if I pick it there's never a healer or tank so the entire team just chain-deaths the whole game.
I know this gets into the debate about what level things should be balanced at...

But fwiw, Ana can only outheal Mercy if you're good at her. Mercy is a way more effective healer at low skill tiers; she has no quick escape if she misses her dart (or if more than one enemy dives her), requires line of sight and accurate aim while healing.

Also, one thing Mercy can do that you didn't mention is the damage boost. I'm honestly not quite sure how significant that is, but it's something.

By the way, I'm not really saying you're wrong. I know nothing, I'm a newbie and a scrub, just giving my uninformed opinion.
Thanks for all the tips man! I really appreciate it. Gonna concentrate more on these areas now. Hope I improve. 
I love the Rein mind game. I usually lose, but it's so much fun. Also Rein vs Orisa.
I'm hoping it will discourage people who use KoTH maps for "practice."

I've run into a lot of matches in the past where people switch heroes for no reason after a 2-0 lead and play something off-meta they don't have much experience with because they see that lead as a "buffer" to practice. They basically throw for 2 more rounds and then try to win again in the last round. Vice versa, I've seen people basically throw playing a hero they suck with for 2 rounds and then switch to their main and cause a reverse sweep.

They're just artificially prolonging the match and risking a loss for their team because they felt like messing around.
Not that long.
Perhaps I don't play as often as others but I have never had a 2CP map last as long as even an average "2-3 finish" KOTH. The only time I have ever left a competitive game in progress was when a KOTH game lasted for *almost an hour,* and once it became clear overtime in the final round was just not going to stop I had to dip because I was going to be late for work.

On the one hand, I felt impressed by the matchmaking putting two remarkably similar teams against esch other. On the other hand, what the fuck yo, we could have done three escort games in that time. 

It made it a real deterrent for me. I fucking hate leavers and I know it probably screwed my team but it was ridiculous.

They stated they were improving the match maker at gamescom.
An idea would be to get good at a flanker, I placed ~800SR in a Season 3 and played mostly Reinhardt up to that point. He's actually useless at that SR since everyone trickles, and Lucio was not very helpful since my positioning or my teammate's positioning would lead me to heal unreliably. I would often be caught out unable to heal anyone. Meanwhile, if I played Zenyatta, I could reliably 1v1 most DPS up until I reached 2000SR, with the added benefit of healing. Apart from that, I've found that sticking to one person in particular and playing with them leads to 2v1s most of the time, and is really helpful. (In other words, pocket healing the most effective after in your team.) If supporting has gotten tiring, After the Roadhog buff, he seems to be pretty self sustainable. Maybe you could give him a try? Don't give up :) 
No worries man, just keep a positive attitude and take 50 SR at a time. Show em no mercy kill everything in your eyesight! 
Its probably the thing i love the most about OW, if your just slightly better with the shield stuff you just dominate. 

Its really sad when you lose it though :/
come to think of that, you are absolutely right. people did that all the time, now they can't mess around like that and can save that shit for QP and Arcade.
I think people are trying to farm their per-hero winrate up.  To what end, I don't know.

People are still making weird swaps at 1-1 this season.  You lose the first round, change the comp dramatically, win the second round... and then people switch again.  Overwatch is a game about switching, I know, but if what you have works, why not stick with it?
Maybe the escort and 2cp games just feel so much longer to me. And now the KOH matches will all feel incredibly short. And I love KOH. Lijiang is my religion.

To put it this way: I'm literally never disappointed when a KOH match comes up, but maps like Volskaya and Gibraltar really fucking kill me.
Uhhh no it was best of 5. You needed 3 wins to win the map
Roger that sir! 
I didn't realize it was a thing at first... Figured reins just kept to themselves and held up a shield. Then I got dominated by an enemy Rein who carried their whole team in a silver match, and was blown away by how bad he would drill me and my teammates, and how well he could keep his shield up. I had to watch him the whole time, and that taught me so much about playing him.

Since then I've been about 50/50 in brinze Rein fights.

My biggest challenge is I'm not good at being opportunistic. If I'm looking for a chance to pin someone, I'm to eager to go in. If I'm focusing on my teammates and on my shield, I'm too slow to recognize opportunities.
That's too bad, it's been much better for me. In my matches people try a lot harder in the 2nd round than they used to. I'm also climbing faster because I can get in more matches with the shorter KoTH games. Losing 3-2 in the last round was always infuriating and meant you just had a match that was twice as long for the same gain/loss as another game mode.

I'm probably getting in another 2-3 matches per gaming session this way.
Oh yeah, please don't think I dislike control maps or KOTH gameplay. They would just be too long. I don't get to play as much as I used to and, frankly, it's disheartening to just get a single game out of a session.
OK I tried but I keep getting bronze players man. Should I heal when there isn't any other healer? I healed the entire game but our team was just.. To put it blatantly they sucked ass.
Pardon my words lol. 
Initiating fights with the Charge is kinda hard and you need everyone on the same page. Use it more as a close ranged thing. There is also a jump+shield trick (Check it on youtube) which will make the play style more aggressive. 

When you wanna go in ask yourself if your gonna die. Taking advantage of the enemies mistakes is extremely important but if you yourself die without gaining an advantage that's bad. Don't hold in your ult either if you do things correctly you should have it up quite often. 

Play Winston as well, both tanks focus on initiating fights so while both play differently you will become a better Rein/winston player by playing both. 
I feel you, my friend. Good luck! Hope you find some time to play this season! 

Friday 'This Week I Learned' Thread - 2017, Thread #22

Orisa, Torb, Sym, Junkrat &Mercy comp problems
I'm having trouble against this comp, particularly on first point Hollywood. I thought pharah widow might do it, but no luck. Tank diving maybe, but junkrat has so much damage. 

Anyway I'd appreciate adviceYeh its pretry much cancer :/ only way to counter is with your own cancer!.  Pharmercy would do good against sym junk and torb, also winston/d.va is good wirh reaper.  Junkrat is a solid option
All five of them suffer from sombras ultra, maybe try that with a zarya + big damage dealer combo?
I was in the same situation, I can imagine the feeling to play against that comp. I main Tracer, but I adapted myself to play Phara and ask for a Mercy to follow me and a Lucio to keep the team healed. 

1) kill the turret.
2) destroy the shield gen \ teleporter build from Symmetra
3) keep the enemy Mercy down

If everyone will do his little job, the team will win easily.

If Orisa's shield protects the turret, a symmetra should be effective there, cause her right click attack goes through shields, but I would say Junkrat's the best option there.
Watch the new video by stylosa. It addresses this exact issue. 
Junk shreeds shields fast but you know what kills them faster? Attack bastion, noone expect a bastion on attack and before they realise what the plan is they lost the point.
you have the right idea: dive! dva and winston can protect themselves from the turret dmg and your dps (should) be able to clean up. just gotta be coordinated vs turrets. you also NEED a flanker like tracer or genji to kill sym's tps. if they're all standing behind orisa shield like you implied, dragonblade and pulse bomb will be effective.

tl;dr, to beat a turret team you have to dive and flank because you will not beat them from range.
Go bastion and delete the Orisa and her shield. Just make sure to recon as well otherwise you're memeing
If they're in that corner a shielded junkrat can rain hell on them. I know the enemy rat can shoot at you too, but you can move around to minimize it. They can't really budge from the turret spot. 
Counter junk. 
Cheese them back with things like pharmercy. Maybe get a good flanker that is capable of destroying shield/teleporter. And a dva can definitely help, problem is getting your team to counter switch but this team is definitely shit to play againsnt. I remember getting this exact matchup and we couldn't clear point 1 so we just went full cancer too on our defense and won lol.
Sombra does good against cancer.  Control health packs. Build ult then dive with team
Attack Sym and Junkrat are a fairly effective way to facilitate an initial push and break their front line.

The main issues with this comp are:

* Orisa's shield refreshes so quickly that it's hard to damage the heroes
* Torb and Junkrat and Sym can deal tons of damage without moving to the front line
* Even if you break the shield, Sym's turrets are a huge obstacle to pushing in

Attack Sym can do tons of damage through the shield, enough to significantly hurt Orisa and destroy Torb's turret quickly. She's also an effective way to eliminate the opposing Symmetra's turrets.

Junkrat is a great shield buster, and can do significant damage behind the shield with proper aim.

Of course, the rest of your comp needs to provide sufficient cover and healing to make this happen. Dva, Lucio, and Rein or Zarya are a good balance.
i was already against this comp and there are some heroes (that worked for me). 1st is dive comp with sombra while sombra is distracting enemy team your team can push. 2nd is to fight cancer with cancer (basically same comp vs same comp) and 3rd option is phar-mercy with dive comp (again pharah and mercy distracting others while your team is pushing in)
Pharah/junk/mercy/dva/winston and lucio
A solid Winston along with a long range attacker will make easy work of Symmetra and torbs turrets. After that, a group push can easily overcome this comp.
Ultimately this comes down to Junkrat being the best DPS option on both sides because he's broken now. 
I am on a competitive team, and I’m the main tank. Winston is incredibly effective to getting a pick on mercy then diving out. What you can do is “bubble dance”. Place your shield, then bait the person inside it while you go outside. And when they go out, yo go in, so on so forth. This is good against junk and reaper. Formerly a DPS main, if your widow is in the right position, then you should have at least a little success taking sym or torb out, even Orisa too. Junk sometimes counters, depending on the map and the other tank they run. Double barrier? Junk widow or junk pharah. Hope this helps!

Edit: another thing to remember is KEEP MERCY DEAD. She can’t rez if she isn’t alive.
All you have to do is take Zarya. 100 Charge 100% of the Time.
Yes, as an Orisa main, Sombra can give me a rough time, she's also very susceptible to D.Va bombs, just wait for her to put down a new shield
As someone who has shifted from Rein to Zarya as my primary tank, this sounds like 100 charge all game to me.

I've been running a diving deathball type setup to beat this with pretty good success.

Team looks like this; Winston, Zarya, Zen, Lucio, Reaper, X (Sombra/Pharah/Junk/Hanzo/Genji/Soldier/Mcree have all worked depending on the map.)

Basically in this setup you poke until Zarya is 100 charge, and your team is in a good spot on ults. Zarya at this point is one of your DPS, and she and Winston clear sym turrets then dive the hell out of either orisa or junk. Orisa is the easiest pick as Zarya with her giant cow hit box, plus you get a ton of ult charge off her, and her being down creates a lot of room for your team to work with. From there it's down to just picking the closest target to your team and focusing with discords quickly. 

From the perspective of Zarya, if you are consistently landing your right clicks here during the poke battle/team fights it is easy to get an ult every time your reaper or other DPS has one up to combo. 

Hope that helps.
Kill the turret, KILL THE TORB. Otherwise every step is followed by Kill The Turret Again. I really do hate that turret.
I'll echo this. You either need damage boosted artillery (Pharah/Junkrat + Mercy) or Attack Symmetra to beat this. 

The dive version is running Sombra + Winston. 
Came to say this ^. He talks coordination. It's really important to beat this set up. That's also a problem depending on what level you play at. People tend to run off and do their own thing or not want to change character to counter in most of my games it seems. 
He put out an actual good video?
Shh! Keep it down! You're gonna give it away!
You can also swap Junkrat for Bastion, but as others have mentioned you need to balance sentry and recon modes - don't let yourself get melted by Sym or Junkrat because you're stationary all the time. 
Works in theory won't work in practice Orisa and torb just shotgun into winstons face, if the sym is any good shell right click then microwave and your dead in seconds 
Junkrat has always been one of the best ways to deal with cancerous comps, between his range and shield busting. I don't think the buffs increase his effectiveness much under these circumstances.
As a Torb main, I second this. The second my turret is down or going down, I'll put a new one up somewhere else. I'm not always babysitting the turret either, especially when I'm just using the turret as a distraction so I can shoot from somewhere else. 
Torb main here, kill me first. I'm not waiting for you to delete a pet turret before I'm already in place to drop a distraction turret and be off turning your corpses into armor for my friends. 
Winston main here....doesnt work. Orisa shreds my barrier and shoots my face before my cooldowns are done. She's basically a mobile Bastion with a shield. I have her more than bastion at times. If she's teamed up with a bastion too....I get tilted off the earth's axis. 
Best counter to a cheese comp is communication and coordination! Couldn't have said it better my self 
The mine is 100 damage. And he has two of them now. That means he can delete most of the squishes pretty reliably and finish off two weakened opponents at the same time.

I know Blizzard gave him two mines to help with his mobility, but don't sleep on that extra damage. Plus they both give some pretty intense knockback and can mess up pushes.
It did though, just not directly. The buffs made it much harder for flankers to deal with him, which indirectly makes him better at everything else because he'll be alive more and flankers will put less pressure on him.
I played Winston into this comp, we had a Dva kill the turrets while I focused on keeping mercy from playing overwatch
Not to mention Junkrat and the turret shredding him once his shield is down.
*120 damage

It proves your point better
Any good junkrat was just useing grenade+mine to one shot people before the buff, and any good junk still is. That combo is much faster than mine+mine. Its not very hard to stay out of the range, i think people getting mad about this buff need to calm down and think about how they can outplay it. It really isnt huge.


The ult is a different story
Yeah, his mines could definitely stand to do less damage now so the focus is more on mobility.

But my point was more that in this particular situation - breaking through a cancerous comp at a choke so you can even *attempt* a push - his extra mine doesn't change the game that much. Because the real problem is breaking through that initial wall of force, and Junkrat's primary fire is the most effective way for him to deal with Orisa and Torb.
He'll probably get a damage nerf to the mines fairly soon, I'm guessing. 

Tip for Positive Mindset: why falling SR probably doesn't mean you got worse
It can be very discouraging when your SR takes a big dive, especially after you've already been playing the game for a year.

But here's the rub: remember, SR is a time-weighted average of your "Hero by Hero SR", for all the Heroes you are spending time playing.

We all know our SR takes a dip when we pick up a new Hero. But it's more than that. It also dips when we first increase our proportion of play time on a more challenging Hero.

If you play 90% Lucio and 10% Tracer, then shift to 50/50, your SR will probably fall some. Tracer is harder to play well. But that's a function of the game's limited lens, not you being a worse Overwatch player. You could still pick Lucio back up after a few months and quickly be 95% of the Lucio you always were.

This makes intuitive sense, but I've never seen it said this way before. A more obvious example: Your "Genji SR" might be <500, but the game will only know that if you play Genji on comp, and it will only be factored in for the amount of time you played Genji.

The game uses only one SR number because it has to. But it can't see Heroes you have in your bag if you aren't playing them. More importantly, it gives less weight to those same Heroes if you are still playing them but playing them less, and then more weight when you start playing them more.

All to say, if you're gravitating to more challenging Heroes, or learning Heroes to flex to in order to play better into your counters, you'll dip. But you didn't turn into a bad player.

tl;dr Here's a way to fight the bad feels. Your SR is accurate. But it's limited. It's a weighted average of the Heroes you're currently playing. That's just the game's lens. It has to be that way, but you didn't get worse. You almost certainly got better.Also, it's worth noting that simple probability dictates that - when you're around your "correct" SR - you will eventually encounter losing streaks and a reduced SR. Just as you'll encounter win streaks eventually. It's the result of the 50/50 balancing Blizzard does.
After my 900 Sr losing streak i can say with confidence regardless of what you do a huge parts of all matches is decided regardless of how well you do.
I hope whatever op mentioned is true. (probably not). Still hoping.... 
Mathematically, it kind of has to be true. Your SR is definitely a weighted average of the Heroes you're actually playing.

There's a Hero on the roster that you never play. The SR system has no idea of your skill with that Hero. If you played one game with that Hero, it would contribute one game of weight.

This is fact, not opinion. If my facts are wrong, someone correct me.

So if you're playing new Heroes, or playing harder Heroes, all else equal, your SR will fall.

Not saying that's what happened every time somebody's SR takes a dive. But if you shifted your Hero pool, there's a good chance that had something to do with it. 👍🏻
I hope whatever you said is true and I also hope sometime in the future season 10 perhaps the report system actually starts working. (yes I get people in my games who lock widow and then troll and even ask us to report, I report and block and I still get the same widow in my game 6 games in one day.) That's I simply said I hope. Everything wrong with overwatch, everything wrong with this community, everything wrong with me probably should get fixed by season 10.

Tldr
I am sorry for the rant. 

so does dm (arcade) use a different tickrate or something?
why is it I can hit anything in dm yet it feels like my shots dont actually land in comp? maybe because i get more fps? truly feels like a different game I think it's cause you are more focused on aiming compared to playing in comp, where you keep track of ults, cooldowns etc
I was wondering if it was lower, i click sometimes and nothing fires. I've never had it in ranked/qp/arcade before. It reminds me of street fighter 4 on laggy connects: sometimes you'd sonic boom and get nothing, not even a jab, as though that frame never happened.
It's because everyone's in shitty positions, confined to close range, fighting in duels, and have zero backup. Of course its easier to get kills
I feel the same, but with me it's mostly because I have big lagspikes in comp while I never had that in DM.
Same problem happens in CSGO, people that wreck in dm (matchmaking is non-existent for this mode, just like in overwatch) then can't hit anything in competitive. In comp you play more carefully, take less chances and avoid exposing yourself, and the enemies do so as well. Basically, you have less opportunities to shoot harder shots.

Or maybe you are just nervous playing comp, it happened for some time to me in CSGO. I was so worried about losing my rank (funny thing is I was at a pretty low rank back then) I could only focus on not fucking up, so my aim was shaky and inconsistent, and that led to more fuck ups. It's a feedback loop that I could only break by not giving a fuck about the outcome and just enjoy the game while always playing my best.
I swear DPS roadhog is back when I play him in DM , but if I take him into comp I can't hit anything. Probably because there are more shields, and people protecting their teammates so it's hard to get a good hook
Your frame rate affects input lag which affects gameplay. If you get better fps in that mode your input lag is potentially lower.  
I find the opposite. In comp, I have high accuracy and kills on stuff like soldier. Can't play Genji, Tracer. Come DM? I win with Genji constantly. Cannot place top 3 with soldier. 
This. Comps a very different animal when compared to DM and TDM. It's a lot harder trying to get kills when so much is going on during team engagements. I sometimes have trouble knowing what I'm shooting at because it's so much. 

I'll have no trouble dominating with McCree on DM but when up against a dva absorbing my shots with Winston and a tracer jumping the back line on my healers who I need to protect with a pharah spamming down rockets pocketed by a mercy and a Lucio all up in my business, the focus spreads very wide. You have a lot of check marks you have to do to be successful in a team engagement and you gotta keep it all balanced so it can be very overwhelming at times, especially when someone isn't doing there part. 

DM and TDM, killings the name of the game. Although with TDM, I have noticed a lot smaller team fights forming now. 
Tick rate doesn't have that effect no matter how low it is. Your shots still fire, timing may be different though. If you are getting nonexistent shots that's a different issue
Sounds like packet loss, check your internet connection
To be fair, Genji isn't super difficult to win with, as long as you aren't total garbage with him. I am by no means good on him (or any other DPS character for that matter) and I can still place top 3 on him pretty consistently.
tbh you don't have 4 genjis flying at you in comp either. 
I am complete and utter trash with him. It's why I'm glad DM exists so I can practice him and not fuck over my teams.

What can I do to carry 4-5 dps in my team?
I can never heal, because I'm either healing them or pushing the payload, but not both at once.

I can't tank, because I will only shield 1 out of 5 allies, or because I will go down in some seconds while contesting alone.

Or I can pick dps, which I suck on and will die as since I have no healer or tank then.Play lucio. Gives your team sustain and speed. Amp it up also heals most DPS characters to full HP. You can contest the payload and enable your team 
My go-to move is Zen.  You can amplify the glass cannon effect with your discords, and they're squishies in regards to healing.

Zen and Lucio are usually the best options because they boost the dps' ability to get picks while providing some healing.  It usually works better than trying to keep them alive with Mercy or Ana, they'll die if the fight isn't secured quickly no matter how much healing you put out.
play 6th dps and fuck it
Zen works great in these situations since the only defense a 5 dps comp has is killing the enemy really really fast. Zen enables that really well with discord orb
If my team is the better DM players, then I use Mercy. The second chance helps a lot. If I have to frag too, then I'll Zen if they don't have snipers or we have ways to deal with their divers. If I'd just die as Zen then Lucio is next choice. 

With 5 DPS, I find healing is more important than tanking. Otherwise I'd just go Roadhog. 
>because I'm either healing them or pushing the payload, but not both at once.

Of course you can do both. You push the payload and tell them come to the cart for heals. You can't follow the DPS all around the map but you can push & heal. 
lucio rein and orisa are your best options but you can also ask someone to play sombra (because she can hack health packs and can be a good disruptor and healer while you're playing tank)
Personally although I can play Lucio I am not very good. I am good with zen and ana both of which are risky in a 4-5 dps comp if the enemy have a genji, tracer or a Winston . If they do, I switch to the one tank on which I feel I can survive, sustain and carry with.
Its roadhog. Zarya can do the same but I am better at hog.

I have quit playing my main heroes aka 76, cree, dva, ana only to concentrate on mastering hog the same way I put 100 hours on cree.
Once I reach a point when I have 95% hook accuracy I believe I may finally get out of my elo. I am currently at an average of 65%, hoping I improve. 
Go Lucio for payload attack and control, otherwise Zen IMO. Mercy's throughput isn't as much of a game changer when everyone is squishy. Zen's discords are super helpful in getting kills and if they listen to your call outs, help to coordinate the team. 4/5 dps can work if you work as a unit. Lucio similarly encourages the team to play near you. 

Both of their healing is pretty good at keeping squishies topped off. 
Sym.  You're a cooldown-based tank w/barrier, you're the answer to shields, shield gen serves as both tank *and* healer, and the turrets provide an advantage in the local area.

She has the highest winrate for a reason.
I can't believe people think "carrying" is an option. Let alone the 4-5 DPs myth. One or two off games are bound to happen, but you will never consistantly get them.




You shouldn't be able to carry at your rank. Because your rank is the one that everyone in your game is at. If you could consistantly play better than your teamates, then you wouldn't be at your rank.



Just play normally, learn about positioning and game sense. Use communication and teamwork. It takes longer than "going x to carry" but you get more out of the game and actually play at your rank. A lot of players have this mindset that "I can carry, I saw my teammate do x wrong", but they don't realize that focusing on your own gameplay is the best way to climb.
I believe this post has been made 29101729271 times
i mean, that is my current strat and reason why my winrate on widow/hanzo/other dps is at 0% :-)
Your answer is so simple. However, people are not simple creatures. When I have had teams like this, they don't want to come to me. They just want to flank to the other side of the enemy and then spam the "need healing" button. If it was as simple as getting the team to group up, then I doubt we'd be seeing 20 of these posts every day.
With "carry" I meant : How can I increase my teams win conditions instead of being a burden.
its ridicolous that the game causes this post for such a long period of time

what do you expect? blizzard set the priority for dumbass skin and event instead of more heroes per year

Advise on starting/coaching a team
So my university this semester is putting money into forming a bunch of new teams like wrestling, equestrian, etc. As a part of this initiative they are letting the newly formed gaming/tabletop organization create esports teams. This is where I come into the picture, since I'm the highest ranked overwatch player at the school so I've been tasked with forming, playing with, and coaching a team for esports.

So my main questions are: how to evaluate players for recruitment, once players are chosen what is the process of molding the players to specific roles, what do I need to learn to be the best coach/team captain for my team. If there are any other esports team leaders out there I would love to connect and learn on how to make this team the best it can be. 

TLDR: university is building teams and I've been tasked to make an overwatch esports team, where do I start? r/OverwatchLFT is by far the best resource for finding players. 

In terms of trying players out, you should ask to look at their statistics, in terms of all time rating. You need to ask them questions such as their experience in team play, and any other questions you want. I've been the leader of 3 teams so far, and I still haven't found an optimal way to try players out. 

In terms of leadership, you need to get the idea that you're the leader out of your head completely when you get into the game, unless you're the shotcaller. Your shotcaller is your leader. There is a problem that I've found happens to me and other people I know leading teams where they end up talking too much because they're in the mindset they should be leading. 

You need to be scrimming regularly, and get used to playing in a team. 

If you have a problem with a player being toxic, you need to immediately confront this once you're done, and make them understand that by being toxic they are becoming the weak link, and therefore will be kicked. However before you bring this up you need to do everything you can to find a solution. 

This really wasn't a great guide, I know, but if you ever need answers, I've been the leader of 3 teams, I've been part of 5 teams, and I know how shit works. Don't hesitate.
Shoot me a message on Discord and I'll help you out where I can: Ehloanna#4519
Thanks for your reply, do you have a discord so we can talk more about this?

As for trying to find players my university is pretty small and so I've already met and played with all of them for a little bit. Their ranks are about golds and slivers, I've had some of my friends that I've met though overwatch look at them and they said that they need a lot of work.

I should have put more info about myself and my pool. currently I've been working on being a lucio shotcaller for a theoretical team in the future but since this popped up I've been working on other roles to familiarize myself on how they work. 

I totally agree with you on toxicity so that's a great tidbit of knowledge.

Is there a place (when we start beginning) that we can find scrims relatively quick?

Thanks again for you help

What is going on with my SR?
Background: last season I didn't play much and placed mid-plat. 

This season I did placement with RL friends (a mistake) and placed low gold. 

Climbing has been a BEAST. I main Zen and have been pulling 66%+ win rate with him. 

SR is killing me. I've played around 25 games and have gained 200 SR. That's it. Last night I climbed from 2303 to 2425, then lost 2 games that dropped me to 2330. 

It seems like I'm gaining next to nothing (less than 20, seriously) and losing a ton (40+). What the hell is going on?

I am definitely performing. It's not uncommon for me to have silver damage and silver healing or even gold healing, even with a Mercy. I'm orbing everything. What is going on?66% win rate over 25 games means 16 wins 8 losses 1 draw, in other words, 8 more wins than losses. 200 SR / 8 games = 25 SR per game. There is nothing going on with your SR. This is perfectly normal.
You are either:

A - doing bad with other heroes, negating your winrate on zen

Or

B - not telling the full story and and lying

If you are winning 2/3 of your games on a hero that you pretty much only play, you are not going to be winning sub 20 SR and losing 40+. Post your overbuff and I bet we will see the problem. 

With that being said, 200 SR gained over 25 games isn't bad.
Link your overbuff
This. Learn to use basic math?

I have some questions for OR15A mains
I've tried playing her but it always ends in disaster, usually the enemy team just rushes me and I die. So I'd like to ask OR15A mains some questions to help me out.

Where should I position myself and my shield? 

Should I use my shield off CD? 

When should I use my halt ability? 

When is a good time to ult and should I place the bongo beside me? 

When is she an ideal pick and when is she not? 

Can I solo tank OR15A?

What can I do against dive?I have a 62% win rate on her right now, and since season started it's become clearer and clearer to me that Orisa might be a great hero to climb with this season. 

Use halt to:
Fuck up Bastions position
Keep enemies from rushing you
Pull enemies off the map

Place shields where they allow you and your teammates good positioning.
Orisa can place new shields fast enough to deal with spamming junkrats - halt him into line of sight and end him. 

My shield is never off cool down for long. 

When rushed by enemies you should enter gold mode, or whatever it's called, and try to dance around your barrier, just like a Winston would. Your added armor, effective dancing and halting enemies away from you can be effective. 

If your team is the kind that can't stay together for more than a second, you're fucked. 
Just picked up Or15a this season. Went 7-3 on placements and landed at 1800 (for what it is worth).  I noticed that if my team can't kill anybody you are going to have a bad time. My three losses came from my team being incapable of securing kills. Spamming the group up call has helped a bit, but sometimes your team is just gonna do whatever they want (console btw)

Disclaimer: I do not think I am amazing not an authority on Orisa, just love the Bongo of Justice. 
You should shoot the shield straight up before the game starts i takes 6 sec to come down and it goes on cd when you shoot it so you should have the next 900hp shield in 2 sec or something.
Played a lot of orisa last season, even climbed to 3400 with her. With her new buffs she's actually a killing machine. Get good at leading your shots and always aim for the neck. Your green ball is almost always a guarenteed kill, just fire into it before activating to maximize damage. Shield dancing is great when you're in a tight spot, especially if you have to reload. If they have rein save your gold as long as you can, if he charges into it you can chunk most of his health away. Reaper used to be a huge problem but i find with the higher projectile speed he's not too bad. 

Converted to PC from PS4 at the end of June, today I hit one of my big goals!

bt BunnyBrigade#11616 https://www.overbuff.com/players/pc/BunnyBrigade-11616?mode=competitive
About 2 1/2 months into my PC gaming career and today I hit diamond! I managed to hit masters on PS4 but I think I might be more proud of this. I've trolled this sub for many moons and I was hovering around 2500 when I decided it was just time to *play smarter* and that my stubbornness really was a detriment. I switched from my beloved Sombra and played mostly Pharah, some Junk and Bastion, filled as healer when necessary, tried to stop making any even nominally negative comments about teammates and actively optimized teamchat (calling targets, ultimates, beginnings and ends of fights). I'm not sure if I'm imagining things but this meta seems much less oppressive than the last and really gives you options for switches. I kind of wanted to do a little write up of the last week because I felt some things finally click that I think other players around this rank could benefit from hearing. Mostly common sense type things you'll find on this sub but *admittedly* may choose to ignore in the heat of a bad match. Anyways, thanks to the many posters of this sub, and feel free to message me with any questions. Feelsgoodman!
how do people who switch from console to pc adjust so easily, and do so well? I've keen playing on pc since s2 and am only hitting gold now in s6
I think people who are willing to spend $120 on 2 copies of the same game on top of ALL the other costs of switching are generally pretty serious about the game. but maybe it's not so much that everyone who switches is successful but you only hear from the ones that are haha

Scrub Pharah Guide Part 1 - L2Pharah
I kept seeing people say to use Pharah to get out of Bronze/low rank, or some other character to 'carry’, but no detail on how. Turns out there's a lot to learn. I climbed out of Bronze mostly with Pharah with a 68% win rate, and here are my tips and notes from my experience. I actually have so many notes that this guide will be split into at least two parts. This part will focus on learning Pharah and is aimed for newer players, some basic game knowledge is still assumed however. There are also some tips that will be useful for anyone in low rank. 

I am a new to FPS player myself, not a high-ranked streamer who tried out low ranks as a science experiment (not to imply those guys don't have useful advice- it's just a different perspective). I mostly played Soldier or supports initially and started off season 5 from the deepest, slimiest depths of bronze, SR < 500. (When you’re that low, that’s all it says - you don’t have an SR number.) Part of my drop was unfortunately due to computer issues (quickly fixed) but I still had lots to improve regardless. It was discouraging to not know how low I was but I knew I had nowhere to go but up. 

**Play Nice, Play Pharah**

So why is Pharah effective in Bronze? Everyone says it and now I've seen it - many people at low rank really do not look up or try to counter her. There is often not a hitscan (characters who have the easiest time shooting Pharah due to being hitscan, e.g. their primary fire shots instantly register as a hit, versus projectile shots which take time to travel) such as Soldier or McCree or if there is he may never even shoot at me until I start raining rockets on his face and even then he can barely hit me. I've had the occasional round without a single death because of that- but I'm just not that amazing at dodging and peeking. Take advantage when you can but don't let your guard down- sometimes there will be a Soldier who can hit you or a Zenyatta who discords you every time you stick your face out. 

As Pharah it's easy to see what's going on in the fight from up high and dive down or flank to eliminate a lone healer, which can swing games since teams will frequently only run one. There are also a lot of people playing Symmetra, Junkrat and Torbjorn- you can typically deal with them easily as Pharah (even with the recent Junkrat changes). Doomfist was introduced since I started my climb, but he is not much of an issue for Pharah either. Pharah can also be fairly independent - you can bomb the enemy a bit, take cover and grab a healthpack if needed, then repeat. 

**Pharah Basics - Flying the Friendly Skies**

I was somewhat reluctant to try Pharah at first because it seemed like it might be hard to fly and aim but it's actually not that hard. Her rockets are forgiving as they deal splash/proximity damage, so you can be effective without perfect aim. The rockets also have knockback which bops the target a little if you hit them in the feet, giving them a predictable path, and you can use concussive blast for a similar effect. Additionally, players in Bronze often run in straight lines or clump up which makes them easy to hit. Using her rockets as suppressive fire (shooting at doors/chokepoints where an enemy is about to come through) is also effective at discouraging attacks and sometimes lands kills. You can also shoot at walls for splash damage on anyone nearby. The splash damage affects her too so be careful about shooting too close to walls, railings, shields and other players. 

*Aim Drills*

First things first. I do aim drills with Soldier (my secondary DPS) and now with Pharah. With Pharah in particular, you need to get used to shooting from the air and learn to watch the enemy's movement so that your rockets will hit where they are about to be, not where they currently are, as the rockets have a travel time. It sounds harder than it is- again at the lowest levels of bronze, many players have poor movement. However, as you rank up you will see less of that, so start drilling!

Yes, drills can be tedious. No, you will not magically see results immediately. But there's a reason so many people recommend it and there's a reason drills are done in every sport, physical and virtual. Even 10 minutes each play session will go a long way. It took a couple months (and I really wasn't that diligent about it) but it has made a noticeable difference. I either use the training range or a custom game. For a custom game, dial up Pharah's health, dial down or disable the other characters’ abilities, add a few enemy AI bots (no Lucio at first) and focus on tracking and shooting while flying. When it gets easy, then add a Lucio or two. 

Here are some other good drills - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqfCiybLvys

*Quick Play Practice*

I did not jump right into competitive mode as Pharah without some decent time in Quick Play and some time watching tutorial videos. The new Death Match mode is also very useful for practicing dueling and mechanics but you still want practice on the full maps. Spend 10 hours or so in Quick Play to get comfortable with Pharah's abilities and on the maps - even if you've played the game for a while already, it's a different perspective on each map as Pharah. 

Aim to die as little as possible and get a good average E/D (eliminations to deaths) ratio throughout your games, win or lose. 2+ is the minimum I aimed for- anything less and you're not doing your job as a damage dealer- you have to kill the enemy more than they kill you. Higher is of course better. It should be obvious that if you get something like 2 kills and 0 deaths, your ratio will be good, but you are not aggressive enough. You should generally have gold or silver damage. Medals are NOT a reliable gauge of whether you're doing well since they’re only relative to your team, but they can tell you where there’s a problem - if you can't get high damage and elims consistently then there's something you need to work on. Pay attention to your death replays and/or record and review your games so you can learn from your mistakes. 

Quick Play will have less than ideal team composition and people goofing around but... so will competitive mode. You can never blame your team for you doing poorly. NO EXCUSES. Even if I don't win, I can typically play consistently well even in QP as Pharah regardless of my team. Pharah can operate independently at times, so not having a healer or tank isn't the end of the world. That said, sometimes it will be more effective to stick with your tank to use their shield or protect your healer. However, even though your goal is to practice Pharah, switch off if you're just dying constantly- you also need to recognize when Pharah ends up being a poor option. 

If there's two or more of the following and they know to go after you, it may be time to switch- Widowmaker, Soldier, McCree, Bastion, D.Va, Zenyatta, sometimes Winston. I also prefer to avoid Torbjorn in combination with Bastion and/or Orisa if no one is helping to focus either - without a shield tank or a good D.Va I end up skulking behind cover too much and not taking advantage of Pharah's mobility. That said I also use Quick Play to practice dealing with Pharah's biggest threats like Soldier or McCree. It remains to be seen but I expect with the upcoming D.Va changes (new missile ability, ability to shoot while flying) she may become more of a threat toward Pharah but also a bit easier to kill due to the lowered Defense Matrix time. 

Also spend a little time in Quick Play hunting enemy Pharahs as Soldier or D.Va so you can learn what they can use against you. You should have a couple other characters in your pocket anyway for when you need to switch or in case someone else picks Pharah. McCree works too but requires better aim and positioning than Soldier. 

*Pharah Basics*

As you're practicing, here are some more things to keep in mind. 

* Pop out from cover in different spots both horizontally and vertically, either from the ground or by flying up to shoot and then drop down behind objects. Then come back from another angle or entryway to keep your enemies guessing. 
* Always be by cover - know which way you can go for safety if you start taking fire. Pharah is very squishy, so in general I try to duck out before I'm down to half health unless it's obvious the enemy hitscan can't aim or I'm challenging an easy to kill enemy. If you're going to put yourself in the open entirely with no escape route, make sure it's for good reason (e.g. to take out enemy healers or you have numbers advantage and you're finishing off the enemy) or be sure a healer has your back.
* Get comfortable with keeping yourself in the air as long as possible and don't drop in the middle of enemies or without cover- it's so easy to kill a Pharah on the ground. Tap/pulse to use her hover jets, don't hold the key down while fighting (except to get up on ledges) and let go when you use the jump jet to let the fuel recharge. A tell of a bad Pharah is one that drops down too often. 
* Avoid small enclosed spaces if enemies are inside, unless you know you can dive in and kill them in one hit and/or you have them on the run. Take immense care to bait out key abilities or don't even bother if it's a Junkrat, Reaper, Symmetra, Mei, McCree or Zenyatta. Almost all excel at close quarters fights, Zenyatta is mainly dangerous if he knows to charge up a shot first, just assume he will. 
* Learn where all the high spots are that you can land on - you can't land on slanted rooftops for instance, though you can slide- so that you can use those to flit from high ground to high ground. 
* Learn where the health packs are, in low ranks you can't always rely on your healer(s) to look up either. Whenever you find yourself low on health and were unable to find a healer or health pack, go into the map later in a custom game and figure out where you should have gone. 
* Pay attention to where your healers are, if you need healing and your healer is nearby, make it easy on them and drop back to cover with them or fly in front of them if safe to do so. Don't expect Mercy, Ana or even Zenyatta to be able to get you healed if you're just out of sight up on a ledge - none of them can heal without line of sight. With Lucio you just have to drop down near him for a little bit when his aura is yellow. Otherwise hitting that 'I need healing’ button is just going to frustrate your healer(s). Do hit the callout otherwise if you are behind or next to them and they might not see you but don't spam it. 
* Pay attention to the kill feed, the skull icons in the field and the health bars (you should turn them on in options) of your teammates so you can decide better when to duck out or retreat in a losing fight, save your healer or help a teammate win a duel. Periodically check the status screen when you die or when there's not much going on. 
* Learn the routes where you can sneak around behind the enemy and learn to do it when they're engaged from the front with the rest of your team. 
* Learn the uses of her concussive blast - this is a super useful ability. For maneuvering - to quickly move from spawn, to escape an enemy or to quickly dive someone. Using concussive blast to get away has saved my life so many times- aim at a nearby wall or floor and shoot yourself backward and away quickly. Or turn 180, use it and turn 180 to move yourself toward something. Practice this in the training range or in a custom game. To boop - offensively and defensively - boop away enemies to save yourself or teammates, boop enemies off cliffs, boop enemy healers away from their team, and boop enemies (a slippery Lucio for example) off the payload or point to prevent them from contesting, especially if you're close to capturing or it's overtime. Since the blast sends the enemy in a predictable direction, it's also easier to shoot them then. 
* Get in the habit of waiting for others to respawn so you don't fly into a fight alone or severely outnumbered. If you're the only thing to shoot at, even players with poor aim can eventually take you down. 
* Work on building your ult quickly - if you’re spending too much time flying around and not shooting at something, you won’t build it quickly.
* Learn to use your ult wisely- not too low in the air so you're too easy to target quickly and not so high that you risk not killing any targets at all. Don't ult when D.Va is in mech or when hitscan (Widow, Soldier, McCree, Sombra, etc) can get you easily, and try to target Mercy first so she can't resurrect. Pharah is immobile and vulnerable while ulting, ideally in comp play you can call out for a healer or D.Va to use Defense Matrix to protect you, she can point it at you to absorb damage coming your way (it remains to be seen how helpful this will be once D.Va’s DM is changed). But generally try to take easy opportunities to kill a couple squishies quickly, particularly healers, Soldier/McCree or characters that can be hard to hit like Genji (make sure he already used deflect) or Tracer (after she uses most of her blinks and/or recall). It’s not as exciting to take out only 2 with your ult but that’s still 1/3 of the enemy team! It's sometimes difficult to combo at low ranks but if you can, some good ult combos are Earthshatter + Barrage, Graviton + Barrage, Nano + Barrage, Blizzard + Barrage. Or Barrage as they run away from D.Va’s ult. 

There’s a lot of good resources on general Pharah strategy, check out Valkia's videos on YouTube for more - https://www.youtube.com/user/valkia

**Common Pharah mistakes**

These are some mistakes I see other Pharah players make or that I have made. 

* Dropping to the ground in the middle of a fight. If you're going to drop, you generally want to be behind cover or on high ground. Work on your hovering if this is a problem.
* Going after an enemy Pharah. Pharah is not a Pharah counter- unless your air shots are good or her movement is abysmal, it's a waste of time to fly around and dogfight when you can be harassing her teammates on the ground. If she comes after you, keep one eye on her and dodge, avoid walls and wait for her to drop low or to the ground and she becomes an easy kill. Call out to your team to focus her preferably. However, watch out if she is coming from behind- she likely plans to ult. Warn your team and be ready for it. 
* Not getting to cover or retreating when attacked from afar. Some Pharahs seem to get tunnel vision looking down while in the air. This is basic for any character- pay attention to your health and if you’re being shot at. I once killed a Pharah as D.Va by repeatedly flying toward her and whittling her down, she never backed off. 
* Not paying attention to turrets- Torbjorn’s or Symmetra's. These are free damage and easy ult charge for the enemy, they need to go down first and Pharah is good at handling these. Symmetra turrets are often right behind a chokepoint - you can avoid this by flying very high, or finding another path around if possible. Or you may need to find an angle to shoot through the chokepoint. If there’s a level 2 Torb turret (2 barrels, 300 health and 57 damage per second) you will likely need help to take it out or sufficient distraction. Destroy the turrets and then kill the Torb or Sym immediately if possible. If Torb starts setting up a second turret, it is very easy to destroy while he's setting it up as it won't have full HP. 
* Not prioritizing enemy hitscan. Matches always go better when I don't forget about the Soldier.
* Not prioritizing enemy healers. Don't complain about Mercy's ult being overpowered, just kill her first, particularly after the first couple minutes when she will definitely have rez. Even with her upcoming changes, she will still be a high priority. 
* Standing still in one high spot and shooting. You become an easy target. There are some occasions where it makes sense to do this but the key is to keep it very brief and watch your back. 
* Being too obvious about ulting. If you're going to do an ult from behind for example, try not to show yourself at all until you're about to do it, don't float around slowly toward the back and hope no one sees you. Or wait to do it when you can see that most of the enemy is busy fighting your teammates. 
* Forgetting to melee if an enemy is very low on health. Sometimes you just gotta drop down and punch someone in the face to get that kill. >If there's two or more of the following and they know to go after you, it may be time to switch- Widowmaker, Soldier, McCree, Bastion, D.Va, Zenyatta, sometimes Winston.  

Bastion is not an issue from my experience. Ana can be, especially the ones with good aim and in open space maps (Route 66, Nepal etc.) Even the Likes of Orisa, Zarya, Hog, Hanzo Genji are all pretty decent against Pharah. Generally if you wanna l2p her, you may as well learn how to play against 4-5 counters in one team, because its almost guaranteed they will have them and will know how to focus you. 

>Going after an enemy Pharah. Pharah is not a Pharah counter.

Its easy to land rockets on unsuspecting Pharah id go for it unless she plays it safe at long range.  Trick is to get close, while out if her LoS, not trying to waste time and duel her at medium range. 

How do you play defense anymore? It feels like the last patch slanted it way in favor of offense
I am a plat Season 5 and now Season 6, but have been on a gigantic rough patch since my S6 placements, and it's almost all coming on the defensive side. 

I used to win almost every game on defense. I was a decent offensive player, but I really climbed to plat playing Rein and Mercy, and using those two tremendously on defense. I used to never even worry about not triple capping a payload or getting 90% on point B at Volskaya and Hanamura.

Now, I can't win a single game on defense. Anytime I do, it's because I'm playing Symmetra into a cheese comp or it feels lucky. I probably give up all points in 75% of my games. I'd never even given up 6 points in a payload game, and now I've done it 3 times this season.

I just basically don't know what to do. I used to carry mediocre comps with Rein or Mercy, because you're not going to get a perfect comp, but if you play a hero that helps others, they can shine. Now it feels like I've totally lost Reinhardt, Orisa, and all healers because of so many offensive Junkrats and Roadhogs that are BLOWING straight through either my shield, or the shield that the tank I'm healing has. 

It feels like defense for me and all of my teams are just hanging on for dear life. The tanks shields and barriers are just being melted away, therefore the healers are unprotected, and therefore you need your DPS to be doing an extraordinary job of trading with the other priority targets to hold objectives.

Now, I'll admit, I've had some pretty bad luck with DPS's (way too many Widows with no Widow experience, bad McCrees, Tracers killing themselves), so some of that will eventually turn around, but it doesn't feel like I can put up a fair fight anymore. 

I feel like the obvious answer is "learn Roadhog if shield tanks aren't working, but I feel totally helpless and naked on him if I don't have a Mercy, and I can't protect her on my own anymore anyway without a 1 shot. 

I feel totally helpless and looking for answers, because I used to love defensive Overwatch, and now it feels like you have to execute perfectly just to hold a single point. I play Junkrat.

(80% winrate after 20 games)
I was having trouble with the same issues S5, and I did 2 things that helped. First and the most important one, is I really focused on my positioning. Second, I added Zarya to my hero pool. She really shines when the enemy team is pumping out damage like that.
If anything, it is now actually easier to defend than before.

Torbrissa is really good on some maps/points, and Junkrat is also pretty good now in general so you can run cheesy strats like never before. 

I can imagine a lot of draws happening on Hybrid or 2CP maps especially in lower ranks.
Learn to Zen and help your DPS melt those Hogs down even through their healing. Bait out and herd Junks. Plus you have the best "oh shit button" in the game
Torb is great atm I think, dont be afraid to spam those annoying level 1 turrets constantly, armor for everyone helps heaps also. 
I've been finding offense far more difficult than defense at my elo. So many cheezy comps with Torbrissa+Sym+Junkrat that just aren't fun to play against. My defensive holds have been strong even without needing to resort to those strategies though, and I've been playing the same heroes as you (Rein/Orisa). I've been trying my hardest to stay positive during the games and encourage my team to be brave in defending. Turtling on defense is, a lot of the time, a road to a quick loss.
Shields are still very important and a staple in almost every comp. People are very used to them now. Instead of the huge rein v rein standoff we used to have for 3 minutes each game. That is very short now. The genji knows he has to go flank, the pharah knows to shoot behind the shield, junk and roadie know to spam the shit out of it. 

Tl;dr You can't just stand there as orisa and rein anymore. You have to actively corner peak and play like anyone else would, jump out and use the shield when you need to. 
I used to play a lot of cree. I played him for 50 hours on qp to get good at positioning and my aim was good enough for Plat level since I played cs go and call of duty. I climbed to low Plat all the from 1050 Sr in season 4. Season 5, I ended at low gold Cuz I didn't play much.

Now in season 6 I played cree and even though I think I performed well (tracer, genji and pharah players had a hard time against me.) I wasn't able to climb since even though mcree is technically a duelist he needs support from tanks and heals which obviously I don't get. I play a lot of ana too but I learnt not to trust dps instalocks. Hence I switched to maining hog for now.

Believe me hog is one of those few heroes that has everything you need. Most importantly his ult charge rate and his hooks. I still haven't started climbing fast but slowly getting there.

I am telling you this because I personally feel of you want to be a self reliant tank who can deal damage and punish people for mis positioning . The new buff also makes him a sustain God. So you can give him a try instead of playing rein. Dva I wouldn't really advice as her play style will change by a lot once her rework hits live.

Good luck! 
If you are having trouble with shield dying then learn to use yourself as a shield or just block don't all the time. 

If your team is playing corners then all you want to be shielding is road hooks or other burst. Then when they push in you can use your shield then. 

Be effectively cycling your shield you can have it up way longer. Remember that you and other tanks can take a lot of damage so don't be afraid of soaking a bit yourself then using shield while your healers get you back up. 

Let me know if this helped or if you need anymore help. 
Be prepared for the tire radius to get smaller
What SR? Any tips?
Junkrat is the Tatchanka  of Overwatch and he works
I want to second that Zarya suggestion! Playing her has made a big difference in my defense as well. 
[deleted]
3300

Basically just kill everyone who doesn't respect your space - 1 shot and mine kills any squishy.

Leading the shots is important, you need to learn how to duel and fight at close range. Junkrats who only spam long range chokes are useless. Of course, you should do it when the enemy goes there, but once the fight develops go all Al Kaida on them :)

Don't forget to always disengage with a mine to the face if Genji or Winston jumps you - you can also  throw the mine to the side of the deflect and kill the ninja through it ;)
I should elaborate on my positioning tip. When balancing happens, especially balancing this big, the positions that you need to take change, so while you don't suddenly suck, you may need to adapt to the changes.
You might have climbed a lot end of last season due to people throwing/tilting/no longer trying. Happens every season. 
Any way to deal with tracer? Or just get a lucky shot?
Really nice reply when I felt like you intial response was shot down! 

OP Looking for a more affirmative reply? It seems like you want the community to agree and say defence is harder now.... I don't think it is. I just think people are still learning the changes like mentioned above.

I do agree however that a cheese defence is still very very easy to hold with! 
Yo this is super important so thanks for this perspective. It should really help me out in future games. 
Totally fair 
Throw down a trap and stand on or near it, spam 'nades and dance
Tracer is actually my most favorite matchup. You can hit her with a nade in close quarters easily and then it's just a matter of a mine.

Even if you don't hit the nade, mine is usually enough to trigger a recall.

And most of the time they get stuck into traps when you place them along their used routes :)

2835SR, Pharah main. Need help.
I am a pharah main, who often flexes to lucio and mercy. I've noticed that some days, my Pharah is really good and I can easily get 70% Kill Participation in games. Other times, I just can't even get a single kill. Is there something I should be doing to make me consistant? Maybe recording enemy comps and maps where I win / lose to know my bad and good points?

Another thing I noticed is that when there is a Pharah Mercy mirror I almost always am able to kill them because my airshots are quite good. Even though I am confident with my ability to airshot, should I just focus killing enemies on ground?

I have an irl friend who is currently #4 Pharah on overbuff. ( Gaia#something ) should I ask him to record his gameplay and learn from him?If you are confident in hitting your shots, you probably have to work on target priority and positioning. If there's a hitscan (or two) looking to shut you down, you gotta prioritize killing them first or play more safe until they're occupied with something else. Peek, fire a couple of shots, peek from another spot, fire a shot, etc. 

You should probably also record a VOD and get either your friend or people here to review it. 
70% kill participation is pretty awesome, im extremely happy if i get around 40% or so. Well obvious thing that can affect your efficiency is how many Hitscan they have and how good they are in general. I think its impossible to be consistent as Pharah in this sense, you can still draw attention, spam from afar and contribute greatly, but some comps will just force you to play safe one way or another, more like supportive DPS not main one. But ask your #4 Pharah friend what he thinks about it, would be interesting to hear i bet. 
I consistently have to either kick people off of Hit scans or just pick a third dps because a Pharah in gold is a nightmare. Nobody will shoot her, shield tanks won't block for you, etc. Once I got to play, I just say focusing Pharah and immediately all of the people she has been pissing off will switch to her. I imagine this gets even more true as you get to high player and diamond. 

I am an above average Soldier, but I can destroy a similar Pharah 9/10 times if I have ANY help whatsoever from my team. 

My question is...What do you recommend for killing you when I don't have help? I am trying to learn Junkrat (so i can kill them easier) and I can't do shit about a Pharah. 
I just got to diamond from low plat playing prodominantly pharah. I had to slowly wayne my way off of her every game. 

Typically now I try to instapick her on attack. I stopped playing her on defense because even if they don't have hitscan, they will switch and you can't switch until you lost the first point. 

Basically, soldiers mccrees and widows are not going to have a problem shooting you now since you're in high plat. 

When I am still able to pick pharah on attack, i usually tell my friend "hey watch me make all their dps switch to hitscan" and usually without fail I can get them to pull out soldier and mccree. At this point if you can still stay alive, it's good to stay on pharah because you're making them use so many extra resources just for you. Sometimes even a soldier alone is good tho and they'll harass you nonstop

Pharah isn't a hero who can be played well in any team comp against anyone. She's more situational especially the higher up you go. It's annoying but meh...

Edit: I don't think anyone but blizz KNOWS this, but I'm assuming there is at least a slight mmr modifier for wins and losses. Kinda like in comp if you lose 5 games in a row it'll pit you against a lower sr team. If you get last place and terrible stats for several games it's gotta push you down a bit. I also speculate that gms and top 500s tend to spam that mode a bit more because with their percentile in the population they're almost always going to be the winner. 
what did you mean by i just cant get a single kill

-not being able to kill without dying
-pressured to the point that cant deal dmg reliably
-dmg is mostly there but no follow up/ they get away
-other

cuz the difference between these is quite important imo

>Basically, soldiers mccrees and widows are not going to have a problem shooting you now since you're in high plat

If you're a good enough Pharah you should be able to dance around hitscans. You shouldn't switch just because they have a hitscan, if their hitscan is shit you can go to town. 
Totally! I'm saying it's more likely that you'll run into a proficient hitscan. Even if that soldier can't kill you, a good one greatly limits what you can get away with. 

Even the best pharahs are going to have a hard time against soldier mccree and widow together, or any two of them. Provided the hitscan are a comparable sr to the pharah. 
The only serious threat to a pharah for most of early game is a widowmaker, because pharah has the ability to play so far back that she is out of McCree and Solders effective damage range. In order to run widow the enemy team usually has to compromise some level of efficiency if they run dive as she doesn't provide as consistent dps or survivability as Soldier(although this has been increased with the grapple buff). One thing pharah is is an enabler for the land based DPS such as tracer to remove targets like zen or soldier who will be focused on the distracting birdy flinging rockets from miles away. This is just my take on her usage in dive comps because she can really wreak havoc when there is no prioritization on her (soldier shooting winston, widow killed by dva or winston etc etc.). Because deathball lacks this capability, I dont know how good pharah is there but I assume the principles are the same unless you want to be a land pharah.

[PS4] Overwatch Questions
I've been playing Overwatch for a few months and main on Junkrate, Solider: 76 and Symmetra. I find it difficult on PS4 to communicate as few players actually use their mics. 

I seem to be stuck on Bronze which I'm happy to accept but many of our losses could so well be wins or at least more competitive through basic communication and team-work. 
So, I'm hoping someone could help me with a few questions I have: 

Does playing on QP give you the opportunity to progress beyond Bronze or do I have to play Comp?

How do I actually know I'm Bronze, is that through the colour of the portrait? If so, how do I know how close I am to reaching the next level?

Thanks in advance.Hey bro, your bronze portrait is an indicator of your account level. You need to play the competitive gamemode to make progress and rise through the ranks. Bronze in comp is totally different than your portrait. 
Oh, I get it now. Thank you. 

Requesting VOD Review - Zarya - Oasis - 1600 SR
Hey guys! I'm trying to learn Zarya and would appreciate a [VOD review](https://youtu.be/T03HB7WZWxo). Looking back on it, these are the issues I see:

* I get too aggressive and jump into Roadhog and Reaper's faces trying to body block. Then I die.

* I'm not reactive enough with my shield.

* As a side effect, I never have the charge to secure kills.

* (and I'm not very good at tracking anyway)

* I don't call out enough.

* As a side effect, I usually waste my ult.

* I have trouble using the proper firing mode in the appropriate situations.Not a direct contribution to your request, but have you looked at canas1an's YouTube videos? His basics video has good tips on positioning and when to initiate bubbles.
You preemptively use bubbles too often in my opinion.  

Like when the McRee was going in against the damaged reaper in round 1, it might of been worth it to wait until the next big team fight.

I find that it's best to bubble while you/someone else is already taking damage. Especially do this for your personal bubble because you have a shield that can regenerate. 

Then your ult at the end of round one was okay at stalling them I guess but your team had no idea you were going to use it.  Plus, firing your ult into a dva in mech is asking for it to either A) getting eaten before it can even deploy or B)have the DVA defense matrix away all the damage. 

In general, I think just a little more patience and willingness to back away from fights you will lose will raise your game significantly. 
You use bubbles pre-emptively, and then overextend which gets you killed. Zarya bubbles only last for 2 seconds, so you need to be very careful with the timing. You don't need to use them right away to block poke damage, use them to block heavy amounts of damage when you push with your team. You have 400 hp, so you can afford to take a couple of hits before bubbling. Just make sure that you stay with your healers and don't overextend.

In the middle of fights you sometimes turn around to bubble random teammates that don't need it at all (13:44 for example). You should use bubbles on teammates to protect them from incoming damage, not just for the sake of using them.

You tend to run into melee range when attacking someone, which makes it harder for you to track them, and puts you at more risk (8:23, 8:56). 

When you get trapped by junkrat you start randomly punching the ground... why? You can still shoot while trapped.


I'm a pretty good Zarya, gold level. I can probably play with Plat players too. Anyways, here is my advice:

1. I don't see you talking with your team about your ult and stuff. When you're about to use it, check if a team mate, such as hanzo or pharah or something have their ult. You can combo and get a team kill easily.

2. You have 200 HP as Zarya, and 200 Shields. You aren't supposed to be soaking up damage, unless you have your bubble on. Stay away from reaper if possible.

3. Damage tip: When you use right click, use left click for a bit ( like half a second) then right click. You can dish out 4 right clicks and some left click damage!
you suicide 1v6 a lot...
I've not, thanks for the recommendation!
Thanks for the review!

I don't really have any response other than yeah, definitely stuff to discipline into myself.
Thank you for the review!

At 13:44 I thought our Mercy was going to be murdered by the Junkrat who was flanking her right. Obviously that was a wasted bubble.

The first thing my friend told me when I started playing was to always melee a junkrat trap instead of shooting it. I don't know why. It's become an instinctive bad habit I need to break.
I'm pretty sure traps become indestructible once triggered.

VOD showing Genji on attack vs Thorb and Symmetra (hanamura)
I had a fair bit of people ask me to show a video where i attacked Hanamura against Genji counters so i thought maybe some people here might find interest in watching it as well.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fG1n-Jky8jQ&Now show us how to do this in solo queue when you have 3 other dps heroes on your team running in one by one with only a zenyatta for heals. 
Moral of the story:  have a Rein on your team, and you can kill turrets w/Genji!

While the VoD shows a good Genji, I *really* hope no one is dumb enough to think that Genji is "the answer" in these sort of situations.  

At what percentage zarya ult should I save my pulse bomb for ult combo?
I have heard 70% zarya ult is a good time to start saving your pulse bomb for the combo.  Thanks in advance.70% is safe I think, Zarya can get that in one teamfight. Also don't forget to take other ults into consideration. If you have zarya + rein + nano then you don't need pulse bomb for that. 

Is new roadhog op or am i suddenly good at him?
I've been playing alot of roadhog in DM and then comp/QP and kicking some serious ass with him. I just get a hit off on someone, and then hook combo them. Is he op or am I suddenly good at a hero I've never played. I have this with alot heroes for a few days and then I start sucking at them. They just click for a few days, and then I suddenly can't use them. It's weird as fuckThis happens with a lot of players I imagine. When you are consistently doing well, you relax and continue to do well. Once you start doing badly you feel worse because you have been doing good. These good habits go to shit because you do daft things because you want to be good again. This is made even worse when playing a controversial heroes because you can given no leeway when you do badly. If you do badly on a tank other players don't notice which takes some pressure off. If you do badly with hanzo for one minute you will be asked to switch repeatedly. You start to do even more daft things to prove to these players you are good. Its a vicious cycle essentially. Best thing to do when you are preforming poorly with a hero you see yourself as good at, is to stop playing it before you get caught in this cycle. 

Roadhog however has had some big buffs, and he is absolutely easier to preform with than before the patch. 

I placed too high - people expect me to carry.
I've found myself in a weird situation this season. After five straight seasons hovering around SR 2100, I suddenly placed in platinum. Seven wins in placements, but didn't carry those games in any way.

Anyways:
My duoqueue-buddy placed around 900 lower, so now we're clumped together in gold matches. Which is fine for both of us, except the fact that everyone seems to expect me to carry the game. Which I most certainly cannot do. And then they tilt.

 Advice? Help? Words of encouragement? I would either just play my best hero every game, or pick support. No one can expect you to carry with Mercy or Lucio. 
Expecting someone to carry them is on *them*, not you. If they tilt that you aren't good enough to carry them, what they are really saying is: "I'm so bad, even a platinum on my team can't make me win."

While, of course, they won't see it that way, that is the reality they are self-imposing on your match. They see your rank and assume you will be *so* amazing that your very presence will secure the win. What they are ignoring--and what is a universal constant among every level of play--is that in a game whose matches are dictated so decisively by team play, one player a few hundred SR (or even 1000) higher cannot possibly make up for bad teamwork and coordination. 

Anomalies will happen, of course, where the higher player's likely greater motor skills will ensure a team wipe at an appropriate time, but for the most part, you (the individual on any team) are at the mercy of your team's ability to support each other.

I have an alt account that I made for the sole purpose of being able to play with my wife as my main account is a good but higher than hers. At first, I was dumbfounded to see that I couldn't even carry the team during our losses. Eventually, though, I came to realize basically what I said above. If your tanks don't know how to support you--or your healers or flankers--you won't be able to heave and ho your way through the enemy team's players. I main pharah, and even hitscans 1000 and 1500 SR below me can be trouble for me if nobody will help me deal with them. If I kill them, but the team is off somewhere goggling at posters in the spawn room, then what can I do?

Another issue I ran into playing at lower SRs was how *different* the game is at different levels of play. You sometimes almost have to, and forgive the term, dumb down your gamesense (in a way) at lower levels of play to compensate for a decreased focus on teamwork (in general) and an increased focus on the individual (ye ole yolo genji ult 1v6).

Anyway, I digress, all that to say this: Don't worry about what the other dudes say. If they think you're presence is going to give them an easy win--that's on them. You do you, and don't let anyone else complain about that. :D
Plat is just slightly better than Gold. Not carry worthy, if you were mid diamond then yes I would expect you to carry a gold game.. but not just one tier difference, that's like saying DUDE YOUR SILVER YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO CARRY THIS BRONZE GAME!!! lol, yah right, not going to happen. or GM carry Masters game.. their just isn't a big enough gap for you to be THAT much better for the WHOLE game.. now, will you have better aim, positioning, target priority and possibly gamesense, yes, but not enough to make a huge difference. lower ranks aren't going to understand that, sorry man. 
It's going to be really hard at Gold. There really is no carrying. At least 5 should be playing well. Let's say you have medals and the most elims. That means nothing when your teammates keep dying and having the respawn - which means the Payload isn't moving, and the control point will never be captured.

Realistic Advice - get some new Plat friends on the side. If you have friends that expect you to carry them, they have the wrong mindset. There's carrying in other games, but not in Overwatch. We all know what a 5v6 feels like - so if even one of your teammates slacks off and doesn't take Competition seriously, you will not be winning many games at all.
First of all, don't belittle yourself by saying or thinking that you placed too high. You placed where you belong and what you've earned. If you didn't then you'll correct that as you continue to play and you'll fall to where you belong.

Second of all, you can't be plat and play with someone who's 900. But assuming they've ranked up some and/or you've deranked some, then at minimum you're 1000 SR away from one another and your team average is somewhere in the middle. Now, if that person is the lowest on the team by [nearly] 1000 SR as compared to everyone else then they're only playing up into ranks above their skill cap. That means you're playing closer to your rank and would be unreasonable to expect you to carry. 

If everyone else is lower than you by [nearly] 1000 SR then you're playing well below your rank and may possibly be able to carry or at the very least contribute more than 1/6 of the team.

If you're playing matches that are somewhere in between all that then you can't really be expected to carry, per se, but you may be able to contribute a bit more than your 1/6 share of the workload.
If you're in Gold then you can try to use this to advantage.  Take charge.  The wins in Gold are often determined by one team acting more like an actual team than the other.

Even if you're not the best leader... someone rallying the troops and getting people on the same page is very often going to be enough.

Also, they're more likely to have less issue with you, personally, if they think they have tasks that they're failing at and then they put the blame on themselves.  And if things aren't working... it'll be your job to be positive and reevaluate things, but keep them on task.

Of course, if you're a Soldier and they have a Pharah and you don't instantly melt them then they're still going to want to maybe throw shade.  Even then, laughing it off with the idea that they have a good Pharah (even if it's not true - I mean... like they're looking up (no one does, right?) that keeps slipping away before you can get her and such still can go a long way.

Basically... the more you run from a role everyone wants to put on you, the more likely they are to get angry at you for this supposed deserved role you should have.

I think you just sorta have to accept that you're "the guy."
Tell your team you're actually a trash can that got pulled into platinum by some sudden, strange magnetic field and you're on your journey back down.

I would just play as you normally do and try to explain you got lucky with placements. If they don't listen, well they were probably looking for something to blame / tilt about and the salt was going to come up regardless.
Just don't listen to them. If they're literally getting angry at you for not "carrying" then their opinion literally doesn't matter. 

Like... How does that even make sense? They're blaming losses on you because you couldn't play well enough to cover up **their** mistakes? 

What even?

"I played horribly but the Platinum didn't carry so it's his fault"

That's some next-level flawed thinking.
This is absurd. Unless they are borderline diamond (and even then) a plat isn't going to solo carry games every single game, tell those team mates to put in work rather than being lazy and relying on you for an easy win. 
nobody expects anyone to carry in plat lol
As much as it sucks, that's kind of how it is when you are queueing with someone that far below you.  I did it with my buddy for a while until he ranked up.  You have to remember that your friend is 500 SR below the SR he's actually playing at, so your team is going to expect you to make up for his lack of ability to play at the tier you're playing at.

As far as suggestions, assuming that you're playing somewhere in the high silver to low gold range, always play DPS.  You won't be able to carry as hard with a healer or tank, although it is possible.  Except for Zarya.  People can't seem to help shooting the bubbles at low SR and you can spend the whole game at super high charge.  Reaper is also super effective, because you can often get 2-3 kills before they even turn around to look at you, and they aren't good at dealing with him.  I.e. go in, get a kill, run into a room and often you can get another kill while wraith recharges because someone will follow you into an enclosed space.

Tracer and Genji are also super effective because they're hard to kill in general, and especially for players that, and I mean no disrespect, can't aim all that well.  You do want something difficult to kill, or that has self-healing, because you'll probably only have one healer and they won't be amazing at healing.
Mute the tilted
I'm kinda in the same situation except i normally play with a whole squad of friends. After winning 7 of the placement matches as well I got placed 2994 which was 40 over my previous career high. 
My best advice is that try and play at your own rank and if you can hold up then the difference isn't much to be surprised about since everyone is prob going to place higher this season with the new system. And for people tilting over this, either mute them or tell them to never expect to get carried on your team   Unless you have some well known 1 trick or pro player on your team. Even then its still not the best thing to do because Sr means a lot less and you should judge a player by his performance that game not a number you can see at the start 
Play solo queue til your rank equalizes. Just because you can't carry doesn't mean you were placed too high. Being in higher ranks is not about carrying, it's about not being the weak link, it's about having the ability to function in a better team and still contribute. Overwatch isn't a game where the best player always wins (unless you're a GM in bronze - plat). It's a game where worst or most toxic player loses. Don't be the worst or most toxic player, if you have them on your team, minimize their impact on your teammates and maintain a positive outlook. Anyone expecting a carry from you is an idiot and that's not your problem, do your best, and enable your teammates to do the same.

I'm a 3400 Tracer, Gengi, Ana last season for reference.  So I'm not crazy high up there so take my advice with a grain of salt, but I don't think I'm complete trash either. Good luck out there.
I'd say the system placed you accurately, since this time placements tried to put you at the rank you deserve.

If they expect you to carry it's their fault, although I've never seen anyone talk like this personally. Just give it your best.

It shouldn't even be too hard to win since you're going to be playing lower ranked players when duo-ing, you could possibly get diamond.
Ignore them.  If gold players expect a plat to carry them, they're retarded.
How? I ended last season with a high around 3050 and ended at ~2750. I went 9-1 and placed right around 2750.
Play Junkrat
I think they've meddled with the algo. I was stable in the 2000-2200 range but right out of placements I got put into 2300.

My second account has a few more placements to go. Be interesting to see the divide, because I played it with some bronze kid and couldn't carry. Lost like 3 or 4 games to stupid scrub tactics like fucking torb turrets combined with symmetra. (Yeh I tried to carry as Pharah, but there was 0 fucking heals, and every time I wiped their team the Mercy would res. If I hunted the mercy, got her, and then half the team, my teammates would still get bogged down fighting tanks..)
Disable both text chat and voice chat and carry on and enjoy your game. Nobody can talk shit to you or force you into playing characters you don't like just because they expect you to carry, and you're better off listening to in-game sounds and not being tilted.

Also, if you do wanna carry, learning stuff could help. Check out ioStux or Skyline YouTube stuff for example, these are great :)
I wish I had this problem lol
I've played against a Top 500 in QP, probably all the rest were plat. We won because our teamplay... I think that at time this top 500 was duo, everyone else was solo. So communication is really the key :\

So since I think that elo is good, but nothing is better than a good team that stick together and try to avoid tilting.

What I do recommend is to encourage your teammates, try to act a nice guy, boost their moral, ask them to stick together, to push calls (like "mercy low", "reaper down", "regroup", "fall back and regroup" ~~or the salty one: "stop feeding their ults"~~ nvm, don't use this one)
As someone that can get 75% kill participation pretty regularly if i put on the ole try hard panties; carries dont win games. Having a team of people willing to do their jobs and coordinate wins games. 

Just be you and be positive. 
The fact is 10 games just isn't enough to accurately get you at the rank you need to be. Just keep playing Comp and Duoing with your friend if you are losing games you will soon reach where you are supposed to be and there is no more pressure. Just try and enjoy ranked and focus on improving you may find that you actually do belong at the level your at. Either way continuing to play Comp will get you to the rank you deserve
Advice? Solo fucking Q 
You can do one of two things:

1. try and not care about others expectations

2. Stop duoing with your buddy and just solo with others in your rank 
Do they say something? How do you know that they want you to carry?
strangers expect you to do many things, you don't need to meet those expectations. why? they are strangers.

I'm 2700 and my friends are at 1800, I usually just play healers only at that level. 
U shouldnt think that just because your rank is higher than the average of the game they will expect you to carry. When you think you need to carry them, it makes you a little too passive and you make mistakes that haunt you the rest of the game. Or you know just play pharah against gold and let your friend play mercy. Gold dont know what to do against pharah
Say it's your brother's account and ask how to enable the big shield on the "knight character"
In overwatch its very hard to carry if your team is bad, almost impossible. Im currently smurfing in plat as a low GM peak dps main. I feel like plat is WAY to random some games are so easy its not funny next game your 4 gold as winston while having 4 dps. 

It doesn´t matter if your true SR is 1000-1500 above some games are just unwinnable even if your having the game of your life, the trick is to know that if you are good enough you will rank up overtime.

So you can have an big impact on your games but being plat in a gold game wont make you carry. 
CTRL+SHIFT+C

Enjoy.
Let's go ahead and call a humblebrag a humblebrag. This is the definition :P
i got in the opposite situation

found troll in 8 games out of 10 of placements, placed 400 points lower than before. wich is kinda fine as i steamrolled the opposing team with attack Torb (7 win 2 draw 1 loss) and eventually played a few matches with some guys randomly laughting our asses off as the turret was killing almost anyone
1. Play junkrat
2. Always hold trigger / m1
3. ????
4. Profit
There are plenty of times when Mercy can and does carry teams. Lucio can too although I would agree that his impact is generally much less than a Mercy unless the skill of the player is ungodly for the rank they're in. But Mercy carries aren't exactly uncommon among mid ranks. If your team neglects to kill her consistently and keeps feeding her ult charge by trying to kill the people she's healing instead of her (which is also, sadly, not uncommon in mid ranks) then she'll frequently have res. So when you do get that team wipe, finally, she just undoes it with a button press.
Actually you can carry with each characters, even as mercy with those great rezzes and healing priorities or Lucio with those boops/good speedboosts/sound barriers.

The thing is how much of a potential you have to carry, in the DPS role the potential is the best, as you're the character who can do the most elim/damage wise. With tank you can carry pretty nicely as well and healer is the with the least potential, but it still 100% possible.
Lol, this is actually not bad advice. But it would suck having to pick something you don't usually play just to circumvent your team's expectations.
A good Lucio can team carry
But he is pulling up the average SR for the team by queueing with someone so much lower (assuming the rest of the team is silver). That could lead to harder matchups for the team. Or, to look at it from the other perspective, he's bringing a lower friend into a match where they won't be as effective (if the rest of the team is gold/plat). If you can't carry a friend almost 1k SR under you, I feel it is at least somewhat unfair to their teammates.

That said, I may be biased because I've played with several plat/silver duos in my placements and we often lose. 
I am in silver and this frustrates me so much. I constantly track enemy and team ults but ult useage prediction is impossible bc silver players dont know how to use ults. I played a game witha dva who never used defense matrix on the reaper who got several 4 mans (some that i rezzed others i couldnt and asked the dva to worry about it, and as i scream hes gonna ult he does and we all die and she never turned. The problem is my aim is like that of a 2 yo
No, one diamond cannot carry 4 golds. Unless those golds does everything he says, he really can't because this is a team game. If this was a bunch of diamonds and plats and one gold, more possible to carry.
Was looking for this answer. I would just stop playing with the friend until he too hits plat.
OP said their buddy is 900 SR *below* them, not 900 SR total. So OP is Plat, their buddy is high silver/low gold. Their games fall in mid gold, and OP doesn't feel like they play at a significantly higher level than that (to carry) since they've historically been low gold. I can understand that.

Honestly I don't think OP can do much besides play heroes they're strong at, and ignore the comments. I went on a bad losing streak a few seasons ago and got called a "thrower" immediately, and still got flack after I picked a widely selected hero and clearly played to win.
I hate comments like these. Just because you play in higher ranks doesn't mean the dynamic that exists there doesn't exist in lower ranks. A mid/high plat in mid gold is the same as a mid/high GM in a mid master game. The majority of the game plays in gold and plat. Your condescension isn't necessary.

Plus, your comment doesn't even make sense. I'm in solid mid plat, if a mid diamond player joins the team, people definitely expect him to carry.
if everyone is 2400 and there's a 2800/1900 Duo in the team, the rest of the team will definitely expect the higher ranked to play the higher impact player. 2800 Phara with 1900 Mercy would be 10x better than 2800 mercy with 1900 phara. 
Yeah, that's why I posted this in the first place. I suddenly got a string of games where people explicitly asked me to carry. It was weird, never heard people asking that of plats in gold before. Small sample size, and anectodal as hell, ofcourse. 
Directed towards me in the OP? I reaaaally tried to avoid making that impression. And got a lot of great answers. Cheers again, everyone:)
This is true, I pretty much main Lucio and Mercy and can kick ass, but there's definitely less pressure to carry with a healer, and I think that was what the OP was looking for
I found that in order to carry as Lucio you need to communicate a ton, keep track of enemy ults, targets to focus, announce your speed boosts, etc.  You need to be a team captain/shot caller in a way.
Mercy main - I love locking onto a tank to heal only to have the other team focus on that tank. Thanks, I'll take another Ult. 
Mercy's kit carries in that it resets fights by virtue of hide and seek. The hero is brainless
Can but isn't necessarily expected. Technically anyone can carry, but it won't be as bad on OP if he was to choose support
No
I run into this a lot too. It's definitely a factor, but not a definitive one. Of 6 players, the average SR increase shouldn't be TOO significant. 
Yes, that *is* frustrating. Honestly, this sort of thing still happens in some of the upper levels of play, but can be circumvented somewhat by queueing with a couple friends you know that you can rely on. 
A diamond in a match with 11 golds can absolutely crush everyone and lead his team to victory. Gold players are have an idea of how to play, but will likely make many, many mistakes on top of not having quite as good accuracy or reflexes. The diamond player will make mistakes too (you really can expect mistakes until GM, and no one is perfect), but lower ranked players are far less likely to punish them. He won't win every single match, but he will certainly win most of them.

edit: that said, it's not OP's problem if others think he should carry. Just relax and play your best, and don't worry about how skilled your teammates are; they're still warm bodies and they'll still fight for the win alongside you.
Yah you tell that to a bunch of holds getting destroyed by a diamond soldier in arcade mode..
Ah, you're right. I missed the "lower" part of the statement. I read it as 900 [SR] rather than 900 *lower* than OP. My mistake.

Nevertheless, the point still stands. If OP is playing in matches that average as low as or nearly as low as their friend then OP is significantly more skilled than the other players on the team/match. There's a high chance that OP can carry those matches or at the very least contribute a significant portion of their team's workload. Alternatively, if the team average is closer to their own SR then there shouldn't be any expectation to carry a match/team. If the team average is somewhere in the middle (approximately 3-400 SR below OP and above their friend) then OP can probably add a bit more effort to the team but there shouldn't be any expectation to carry.

I get that OP *feels* like they don't play at that level and if they're right then they will fall. However, if they don't then they're just short changing themselves and deprecating their own worth. That's why I suggest not belittling themselves. Take pride in what you've earned and run with it. Don't get over confident, though, that can hurt. But so can not having enough confidence in yourself.
One thing that I haven't heard anyone talk about is that he is probably bringing up the average SR of the games by about 200, giving his friend harder games than they are used to. When I play with my high plat friends, the games are marginally harder. I can still contribute but I have to really put my game face on.
>  A mid/high plat in mid gold is the same as a mid/high GM in a mid master game.

the difference between mid plat and mid gold is not equivalent to the difference between gm and master, it's more like the difference between 3700 and 3600
Actually around mid-high masters you start seeing GMs and Top 500's every few matches; there's simply so few of them that they filter down to Masters matches sometimes. Plus it's also a rank where most of their alternate accounts spend a lot of time. There's always some standouts that seriously kick ass, but for the most part everyone contributes meaningfully whether or not a few players are hundreds of SR higher.
i dont expect anyone of my team to carry. thats a bad mindset. ive seen shitty top500 players that cant hold their ground.
Tbh I expect the 2800 player to be worse. That's just my usual experience with higher ranked players who make it into my games.
Could be. But I don't see a single indication of OP mentioning any expectation to carry as a healer/support. Nor any specificity of Lucio or Mercy. OP could be a tank main or dps main.

Nevertheless, it doesn't matter what character they play. You can carry with just about anyone/everyone if you're skill is high enough compared to the other players in the match. Some characters just have an easier or higher potential to carry. Namely, dps characters.
i think playing mercy has perhaps a lot more pressure than just a general dps (not all, some are also very high pressure) due to the nature of her ult. if badly used, she can throw and essentially lose the entire game due to the extreme significance her ult has in impacting play :/ also everyones spectating jer while dead so its really easy to spot her mistakes and when she missed /the/ rez that wld win the game. just some thoughts

edit: granted this may not be very relevant to OP but ehh
Except people complaining about not getiing healed on the middle of the battleground surrounded by 5 people. Or not reviving when your ult isn't even ready. Salt flows everywhere sadly.
Those are definitely good qualities out of a Lucio player. Often times I see Lucio's that either never speed boost when needed (or at all) or never get off of speed boost and heal when needed. I find it rare to get a good mix of both with randos. But that's just my experience.
What's extremely frustrating is this is so common even in plat/diamond. This is like "How to kill Mercy 101," and people still can't figure it out. It's frustrating as hell that I have to keep calling out repeatedly to "focus the Mercy."

Then people go on to whine and complain that we can't kill anyone and/or we're losing. Like, "if you'd just focus the Mercy instead of the Rein then maybe we could make some progress."
Mercy being a low skill floor character doesn't mean she can't carry. Soldier is a low skill floor character and he can very much carry a match.

As far as skill and difficulty with Mercy goes, playing hide and seek is only relevant when she's holding res. In the time it takes to charge she is generally bouncing around a battle field except in those moments where she can heal someone from behind cover, which is smart. But it's those times when she's dancing around the battle that no one is taking the opportunity to kill her that allow her to carry a match. It's not even a res necessarily. It is certainly a big factor, but a Mercy being left unattended can carry matches without ever having to pop res. That is pretty true for any healer who's left alone. 
I'm a Lucio main that carrying out of bronze, if you never get off point then the enemy will lose
Yeah, as I wrote that I realized that usually they end up placed with gold folks. In that case, it ends up being a question of whether or not the silver player can play at a highish gold level. 
No, they can't. They might be able to with some luck, but not absolutely. I think it can seem like that for golds because there's such a skill gap between golds and Diamond (even between low-mid Plats and diamonds), but because of the way Overwatch is structured, it's really hard for 1 Diamond to carry a bunch of golds. It helps he's duoing with a plat, but again, because this is a team game, it's really hard.

That's why when you see videos like these they use GM or Masters - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PQe2pUcJgRk

Gold players have basics, yes, but, I was literally in a game with my barely plat and gold friends and they didn't know the payload can heal them. They also thought it was OP.
sure, a soldier can destroy a bunch of golds in arcade (which is not even close to an example of a comp game). But comp is an objective based game. Whether it's holding the point or moving the payload. Diamonds are better then gold, but when it's a team of golds with 1 diamond, it's really hard to carry because being skilled isn't aim. It's also game sense and ult management. Unless those golds follow the diamond's instruction to a tee, it'd be really hard to carry.
Lot of good advice here, cheers guys. 
I chose to answer to this one mainly because of this:

"Nevertheless, the point still stands. If OP is playing in matches that average as low as or nearly as low as their friend then OP is significantly more skilled than the other players on the team/match. There's a high chance that OP can carry those matches or at the very least contribute a significant portion of their team's workload. Alternatively, if the team average is closer to their own SR then there shouldn't be any expectation to carry a match/team. If the team average is somewhere in the middle (approximately 3-400 SR below OP and above their friend) then OP can probably add a bit more effort to the team but there shouldn't be any expectation to carry."

See, I don't really care whether I'm mid-gold or low platinum, or somewhere around there. The thing I'm noticing is that people see the plat badge, and assume I'm that much better than the rest of the players in the game. 
I'll probably drop down to SR 2300 and stabilize around there, but that silly badge will follow... And since I'm always playing with my buddy (no idea how he placed that low, we had five of the placement wins together), I'll pretty much always be the only plat in the game. 

And since I'm incapable of typing out my concern in plain text, I'll try again: Will this plat badge haunt me all season? Or will people manage to just play the game, instead of asking/expecting me to carry?

So the accurate saying is "people are only expected to carry in lower ranks"? Which means OP is even more wrong.
I hover in the 3.2k range lately. Every now and then I get one of those games with GM's in it.

Most recently was last weekend where I ended up in a game with a team SR of over 3.6k. I simply commented "I don't belong here..." in voice chat and everyone got a good chuckle out of it. It was one of the calmer and relaxed matches I've been in for awhile, even though we lost a pretty close game on Kings Row. 
Ok, tell that to people in lower rank games. I'm not saying that's what you should do, I'm saying that's what happens.
As someone who is shocking at Mercy I agree. Also positioning is pretty damn key with her - you definitely can't just pick her up and hold mouse 1 all game without thinking.
  
  
Plus the fact it feels so *wrong* not healing anybody and sodding off to hide that I have a hard time doing it; and I'm not sure before hand if we can just win the fight with me simply healing instead.... fkin Mercy hardest hero in the game.
I think part of the problem (and what I find hard as Lucio) is that in low ranks/my games at least he's regarded as a full on healer and often the second support will think "ok we have a healer" and be a symmetra or an ana who mostly shoots enemies. So, in order not to lose, I often end up being on heal almost full time as I have to heal a lot (and I'm bad as other healers so I can't really switch) unless I'm with my friend who regularly plays Zen/Mercy. If that is representative, a lot of people will climb up with the idea that Lucio needs to heal bc thats kinda true in the low ranks...
For sure. Kill me. Don't be threatened by the blaster...it does surprising damage, but I can't aim for shit. 
Mercy only heals 60hps.  If you can get 2 or 3 people shooting Rein, focusing him is fine. 

His shield also can't regenerate when he's using it to block. His attacks are short range, his hitbox is huge and Mercy can't burst heal. 
Okay I retract my statement. Below plat, possibly even plat, you can carry.

I can't even fathom bronze, low masters feels like a shit fest to me.
It's all shiny at the end of the day tho u kno ;D
My alt account says otherwise, easily carried out of gold with like an 85% almost 90% winrate. And that was on characters I'm not even that good with. If you're 1000 SR above the rest of the match you should usually be able to carry rather easily. The same way a gold could stomp the shit out of a bronze game.
I dunno. I've seen a platinum Tracer wreck our team of low golds. No answer for her, nobody could deal. 

How many games do you win with a leaver 5v6? That's what Tracer did to us every fight. By the time we were able to get organized with dva body guarding healers and grouping up,  the other team had a huge ult advantage and snowballed. Just broke us down. 




I see where you're getting to, yes if they play their normal "trickle fight" and "bad ulting" play style that gold and below do, then trying to be a sole carry will be tough, but mark my words that one Diamond would be a huge issue for any of the opposing gold team heros.. shear mechanics will dominate and much better positioning.. think about the gold healers and how they are almost always out of place and how fast a diamond soldier could wreck that, plus a Pharah, practically just floating still in the air in the open not using her concussive blast at all to move herself.. or a bastion that never moves out of sentry mode, one helix and half clip and done. I understand that coordination sucks and he'll be on that team, but coordination sucks for the enemy at this level too, and the diamond player will exploit that much better and live longer. I don't think we are going to totally see eye to eye on this, and that's ok, they are opinions, a diamond rank will never be in a gold rank match anyway.
>Will this plat badge haunt me all season? Or will people manage to just play the game, instead of asking/expecting me to carry?

Simply put. No. It won't. Badges don't follow you around anymore. They removed that this season. If you drop into gold you'll have a gold badge. The only way someone would know that you ever even touched plat was if they go look at your season high.

Now, if you stay in plat then you'll have that plat badge. I sit mid-high plat, personally, and play with friends that are mid-high gold. I get plenty of matches where I am one of the only, or the only, plat badge and I've never had people expect anything of me like carrying the game.

Most people in the high gold, low plat range know that there are those who will fluctuate around that 2500 divider. They'll go up and down and the badge doesn't really mean anything. I've, personally, ever experienced any unreasonable expectation of my badge but I know that my experience isn't specifically representative of anyone else's.

Not that it matters anyway. Like I said before, badges don't follow you anymore.
I suppose that's one way to look at it. "Carrying" is a silly thing to worry about, though. You carry by outperforming everyone else, and specific plays are just a part of good gameplay. You don't have to 1v6 the enemy team ever, you just have to have a big impact on the match; that could be getting an entry pick as Zenyatta, or keeping orbs on the right targets all game while coordinating focus fire in comms, or saving Transcendence and "tanking" Tracer well enough to be present to save the day against Graviton Surge (to give an example for one character, but it applies to anyone).
I don't doubt that one bit. He is a delicate balance of healing and speed support. When you don't have another healer you'll spend a lot of time in healing for sure.
I've had my fair share of Mercy's kill me. Mostly when I'm on DF. They catch me with my abilities on cd and I only have 4 shots. They get many more chances to kill me than I get to kill them. Plus, unless I'm right up on them, that shot gun does shit for damage.
because low master is a shitfest, even high master is. overwatch ranks lost quality over each season and got further inflated.
You carried yourself out of gold? Or a team of gold?
Again it's probably, especially if the team of golds do as they're told and are smart enough to just "protect the president" (in this case the Tracer), but we're talking about consistent ideal conditions (or a 6 stack). But if they're duo queuing, that means there's 4 strangers, or 4 variables that is harder to control. If he wanted to carry, it's best to 6 stack. Wayy easier.
I think we actually are a lot closer =) I think I balk at the word "carry" and perhaps it comes down to what one thinks "carry" implies. For me, a carry is easy. It's a steamroll. I have used carry in diamond/master games, but I've used it sarcastically because it was quite a struggle and even though I did scrape a win and so was a testament of my skill, I didn't steamroll.  So I didn't really carry (in what I view a carry means). 

I definitely agree a diamond can live longer and so capitalize on mistakes. But I wouldn't see it as carry (because again of how I define carry).

But you're right, that's why these are opinions =) All the best!
Heyoo. All my problems are solved then. If I stay in plat, I'll have SOME expectations to contribute more than 1/6, but that's how it's supposed to be. Fantastic!

I have no idea what we're debating, you're completely off topic. I'm saying OP sounds like a dick for laughing at lower leagues. Besides, a soldier with diamond aim in gold will definitely *hard carry*, as in be the major reason that his team wins the game. Getting all the key final blows, dealing the most damage, making all the big plays etc.
When I saw a stream of a masters game that had widow+hanzo both refusing to switch I gave up my goal of reaching top rank. Comp is a potential shitfest at all levels so now I'm just happy being at a level where i feel like most of the people I play with and against are at same level as me
I, one diamond player, carried games consistently throughout gold. So 11 gold players, and me, 1 diamond.
You too
Extra bonus, even if you end the season in gold with a gold badge, you still get the CR rewards for hitting plat. You still get rewarded for your highest rank you hit regardless of where you end, same as before.
If you manage to stay in plat, it means you probably are already doing more than your 1/6th :).
And that's why my only goal each season is to record some sick plays and maintain a seasonal peak sr of 2000+, without caring that I've been placed in low plat the past 3 seasons. Just working to enjoy the act of trying in each match and maintain a level head in comp is the only real advice I can give to most people complaining about horrible views on comp.
I'm finding it hard to believe you carried, and not, "I struggled to wrangle a win". I've played with my lower level friends and it was a mess, even when we had plats in the game. It only worked because we were friends and so had some coordination, and it was basically me strategizing and telling them what to do and they listened. The possibility I see is what one user suggested, which is spawn camping (or focusing on their healer), even then this is hoping everyone listens to you and does what they're told and focuses on the objective. 
This isn't me 6-stacking with a bunch of golds, this is me solo queue in gold as a diamond, on an account that started around there. It wasn't all that difficult to carry most of my games. Every once in a while you run into one that your backpack just wasn't big enough, but they were the exceptions. And even those, I could usually trace the loss back to something I should have or could have done to prevent it. With a 3.3k player on one team and 6 2.3k players on the other, is it really so hard to believe the one with the 3.3k player usually wins? Seems pretty basic to me
Nah dude its kinda like the gold players stand at weird enough spots it just breaks dkwn into 1 v 1s and then when they group you ult.
I agree, Im a tank/healer main 3.2k and got a smurf, late, last season, was placed 2250(mostly bc of picking dps heroes I was bad at, but wanted to play comp with). When I played Tracer (probably my best dps) I got like 60-70%kill participation untill like 2.5k pretty easily. Even won a couple games with a player less. 

Former top 500 player and semi professional coach going to offer free coaching!
Hello everyone! Many of you probably have no idea who I am and some of you may remember me from many months back but either way I'm here to try and help people! So here is a short bio on myself with a TLDR at the end!

My name is Bbonecapone and in March of this year I started some free 1 on 1 coaching sessions! After a short period i moved on to attempting to coach overwatch professionally I worked with multiple teams and had trial periods with splyce before they disband and with the current envision roster. Along with working with these 2 teams I spent a large amount of time with top 500 players trying to go pro and learnt alot about the game and now I want to pass the knowledge on to you! If you want to take a look at my coaching style I will put a link at the bottom with the TLDR to my previous coaching sessions. All systems are welcome!  (pc, Xbox, ps4).  If you would like to be coached I would request you have recent vods available that I can look over.  If you wish to just have a vod review that is fine I can do 1 on 1 or pure vod review for you.  All coaching sessions will be uploaded to my YouTube channel for you to review!

TLDR: former top 500 worked with pro players and many top 500 players coaching as a team and individually and now I want to help you get better.

YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrJe5j7VA3fnuqQmg2hIbeQ

EDIT: Please do not pm or comment with vods! I can chat with you via pm but all vods must be sent by email (links are fine) to Bbonecapone@hotmail.com

EDIT 2: People coming in fast and furious Jesus so I guess I'll set up a discord to keep my shit organized! So keep an eye on this thread! Also I will only be able to do 1-2 vod reviews a week so people will have to be patient!

EDIT 3: https://discord.gg/ufRXU4y
join this discord and everyone who wishes for coaching can chat with me in there!I love what you're doing here. I'm an ex-GM widow main (not a 1-trick, I flex heal while primarily healing with Ana, and also can play most hitscan dps) but I haven't practiced/played seriously for a solid month or two. Last season was pretty rough for someone like me who's main heroes were countered to all hell by the meta, and so I ended up losing passion for the game. 

Anyway, my skill has gotten rusty so I figure that now is a better time than ever to try to improve my game sense at least to a level that a good player wouldn't consider as just garbage. If I manage to spark my passion for competitive again, then I'd love to learn everything you have to teach. Lemme know if you'd like anything from me, like My bnet, VODs from previous seasons or this season, etc. 

I'm a PC NA player by the way. I have a mic and recording software. I'd love to work with you and get any insight that I can. 
I am very interested in some coaching.  I don't have anything current recorded, but I can do that in the next couple of days.

I started competitive season 3 and didn't do much more than get placement and think i ended in the 1400s.  After placement Season 4, around 1200,  I decided to main Zarya and did so for that season.  I think i peaked just into gold and floated around 1800 most of the season.  Season 5 I decided to main symettra, peaked just into platinum and ranged 2200-2400 most of the season.

This season I decide I would main Lucio/Zenyatta depending on number of people in chat (calling out discords seems to really help team focus fire) and maps.  place 2300 and and am currently 2210.

I'm not sure why or how I decided to switch mains every season, it just seemed like a fun thing to do to keep that game fresh.  Half the time there seems to be a lack of healing, which was why I picked who I have. I could still work on the character I wanted to even when we have 5 dps and myself.  I mostly solo que.

I am an ex high gold - low Plat player. Placed terribly this season. Trying to make it to Plat again. Currently at 1790 Sr.

Really appreciate what you are doing. 
I'm a 6 season plat and have recently committed to solo queue my way to GM. I've set up a twitch account and record all my games individually. I rewatch losses on my phone throughout the day.

I'm willing to play 6-8 hours a day , 5-6 days a week.

If you are ever available, please stop by. I am looking for all the direction I can get.

 
Thanks for doing this! I'm new to the game and a Pharah main. I'm trying to get better on XBone. So, I know that she is very movement and splash damage based, my question is: how do I get better at balancing her abilities? Many times I notice I've used an ability in combat and then can only slowly retreat, many times getting shot down in the process. How do I get better at balancing her cool downs?
Not at the moment though. 
I've peaked 3750 s5 as a hanzo main, recently made it to a dps position in a mid-masters team and need to get better at tracer, soldier, Cree and pharah. Would you be able to help me with that? 
How long will this offer last? I am a Rein/winston/zarya three trick at masters looking to broaden my hero pool but I don't feel like I'm there yet
https://youtu.be/xxi-_mQKGE4 Here us a vod of me.playing tracer I have a full comp cod if you would like I could pm you the while thing my gt is :mcardinals744 if you would like 5o.talm to me I also have discord and Skype and would love some coaching
You're awesome! Ima try and get a good vod tonight, I absolutely slayed in the placement matches as genji but still was placed gold, really has me down because in ffa and quick play I'm always with masters but I think I just have tons of comp grinding ahead of me
3900 sombra main, I'll send you some vods when I get the chance?
Ahh this is so nice. Glad to see you're offering help on multiple platforms, since I'm on PS4. :^ )

I'm primarily a D.Va player, though I do know how to play other tanks and switch to Mercy when healer is needed. Last season I hit 3600 and ended at 3501, after placements (2-8, siiiigh) and losing a few games, I'm only 3200. 

Will definitely get some footage together when I can! Quick questions, do you prefer the games to end in a loss or does it not matter? Also, I don't get on voice but join team chat, is it still okay to req a vod? :^ ) 

Thanks in advance!
Hey I am a bronze pharah junkrat main who flexes a lot. I am not at home, but can I send you some vids today or tomorrow to review? Thanks

All heroes i play:

Soldier, pharah, junkrat, bastion, orisa, dva, lucio, mercy


What heroes would you consider yourself most valuable for? I'm sure someone at your level can help with anyone, but are there some you'd consider yourself more knowledgeable with then others? 
Thanks so much for offering!

I'm a support main (mostly Ana and Zen, but recently some Sombra and Lucio) who scrims with a team.

On a positive note, my team has been climbing SR recently by 6-stacking, so we're now mostly masters. However, we've been struggling in scrims way more than usual. I emailed you a link to some VODs in hopes you can help. :)
Wow definitely taking you up on this.

Any specific role youre looking for? Im a tank main trying to figure out if I need to go dps for comp.
So do you coach only specific characters you're good with or do you do all of them?

I got to GM season 5 with Winston, Tracer, and Soldier, but I've never had outside review so I'm curious to try it.
Thank you so much =) I sent you my Tracer VODs. 
PS4 fringe-diamond player (mainly dps/ flex to tank). I would love to have some external feedback. 

1.) What's a vod?

2.) How can I make and send this from my PS4? Do I need a special recording software? 


Hey, thanks for doing this! I'll send out an email soon
Hi Bbonecapone.

I am a consistent GM player, I have made GM every season since S1 but I hit a wall.

I have never been able to get past 4200s.

I have seen and played and won decently against known/pro players but overall I still hit that wall at 4200s.

I mainly soldier, zen or monkey.

I would say my mechanical aim is above average and I put a heavy emphasis on good positioning/high ground and denying enemy space.  No matter how hard I try I seem to be stuck in 4200s at best.

Any quick tips?
I actually have an amateur team for the OWUL. We're about a 3.4-3.5k average team who scrims pretty often, and always looking to improve. I know you've got alot of requests on here, so I understand if you aren't interested, but let me know if you are. Thanks for doing what youre doing :) 
I actually had a widow 1 trick account in gm as well so I know your pain! And if you do find the passion I would be more than happy to help!
Hey man I can do my best to help you out! When you have some footage send me a pm!
Do you have any vods?
So yes I can help you but before I say more please do not quit your job/school hoping to go pro in overwatch because that is not realistic from plat in a short period. Yes it is great to improve but these must be other areas of focus on life
Cooldowns are only a small part of pharah you positioning is much bigger being near effective cover you can get to quickly
One really good thing to practice is knowing the map well and where you can use vantage points for peaking, play as if you were a floating widow maker, Spamming rockets can be incredibly effective and peaking constantly can avoid two of three of Pharah's worst enemies being McCree and Soldier ( a good widow will probably take the chance to try and head shot you if you keep peaking the same spot over and over).
Ok so once you get some vods hit me up! And we can talk more
I can defiantly help you with that!
Where did you find a masters team and do you need more members? 
As long as I have videos to upload is the goal!
Edit my sr at this recording was 2130
Pleas pm me I will not be taking vods from this thread
Yes you will have to grind! And sounds good
That will do!
I dont care about end game results and voice comms are not a must there are lots of other ways to climb! join the discord for more questions :D
best way to reach me with the vod is through email or joining me on discord
At this point I am very comfortable on every hero I know how their mechanics work and their jobs the only one I probably can't help you with would be hanzo cause I never have played him or coached a hanzo due to him never being meta
Shoot Me a message on discord and we can talk more!
I can help at any role!
I can help with every character!
So on ps4 it's a little more difficult the easiest way is to stream In 720 and save the stream and get it from twitch after!
With out watching at that Elo not many quick tips dying is one thing you should keep an eye one
Awesome. I haven't placed yet because I don't want to jump into comp just yet, but I am looking to get back into "shape" so to speak before I place on my main.
I have an alt account that I somehow managed to place in low master, so I can use that to play in a competitive environment while getting the rust off. 

If you'd like to start tonight, I'd be happy to. I get home most days around 5-6pm EST, sometimes earlier, and I'm usually playing for most of the day on Saturday/Sunday. Would you want to work with me tonight if you're able? If so, what do you have in mind? If not, what are good times for you?
I recorded a couple after I posted and have sent you a pm with a link.  

For anyone who is curious:

I have my life comfortably under control, thank you for your concern. I have zero intention of ever going pro and I'm giving my self about 6 months to pull it off.

I view this as a similar experience to when I got legend in hearthstone. The commitment isn't to be taken lightly. 

I have all the needed gear. I7, 144hz, 150fps,  clicky keyboard and decent enough mouse.

I'm also not interested in being twitch famous. 




Sure man! 
Nice! How can I contact you? Discord or anything else?
Sounds great. So I just gotta send a VOD your way via pm and we can arrange a 1on1 coaching?
Awesome! Thanks for doing all this!
Pm me and we can talk further
Fair enough I just want to be sure :D if you can get a vod I can help you out!
On Reddit for now and for sending in vods I have a email for the vods
change of plans my reddit is exploding lol so i am moving to a discord server!
join the discord and we can chat more yes
There are 20 or so on my page, and I make 20 ish a day. I don't have a specific one at this point as I'm just now experiencing the "oh hell I didn't realize how bad of a teammate I am" from watching my own vods.

You are welcome to use any of them for your yt content. I do talk over them and say stupid plat things, so hopefully nothing is viral meme worthy.

I'm willing to put in the work to reflect your coaching ability. If you see a vod and have direction, I'll be happy to provide you with the resulting gameplay(same map/situation, same hero) after it's implemented.

If it's content you need, I would gladly trade endless amounts of it for game sense.
join the discord and we can chat more through that
Ow unit discord, didn't know there was one. I'll find it

Edit: nevermind, I seen you edited the post
I just made it lol

How I would raise the skill floor and ceiling for Mei while still strengthening the fantasy of the character.
TLDR : change her primary fire so that it no longer freezes enemies, but it slows them to a set speed much quicker, and possibly reduces movement abilities distance by 50%. Freeze time may need to be reduced on the ult slightly. 

Right now Mei is very rarely used in competitive as she has a role that can only be used in specific situations. At the same time she is a bit strong against completely new players as she can just freeze them and put an icicle through their heads while having a ton of survivability. This makes buffing or nerfing her directly problematic as it would make her too strong against completely new players or even weaker at high levels which runs counter to what blizzard wants. 

My proposed change would be to change her primary fire so that it no longer freezes enemies, but it slows them to a set speed much quicker, and possibly reduces movement abilities distance by 50%. The numbers would have to be tweaked a bit for how much they are slowed and how much damage is done. 

Here are the reasons why listed out. 


Raise the skill floor and ceiling- This would greatly reduce her ability to 1v1 opponents as she would need her icicles in order to finish people off without freezing them. She could use the slow to on her primary fire to make aiming easier, but would need to know how to manage when to use either attack while the enemies' attack speed would be the same. Aim would be needed to secure kills on her own and coordination with team would be needed to kill the slowed enemies with the group. Mei would be much more forced to stick with the group and work with teammates to secure her kills. 

Some heroes she becomes better against//
Lucio - Mei would become the best counter to Lucio in this situation since her ability to slow goes to a set rate it would negate the speed boost effect if she focuses on hitting as many targets as possible with her slow. During team fights this would become more of a priority and give her the unique option of hitting as many enemies as possible rather than focusing in on killing individual enemies like most dps heroes. I think this would be a fun way to make fighting with her even more unique and differentiate her role. 
Mercy - in a team fight the ability to slow her quickly would make targeting her much easier for you and teammates as she is typically the first enemy you want to kill. She would rarely get close to Mei though only during big brawls. 
Genji and tracer - Mei becomes much better at zoning these heroes as they wouldn't be able to jump in on supports and just dash or blink away right before being frozen. The ability to escape would be there but it would force them to be smarter about when and how to attack. Mei would be a stronger pick against mobility. The advantage of their speed would be taken away as the slow would be to a set rate   
Zarya - Zarya would still be a strong pick against Mei, but the cleanse wouldn't be as useful to stop a freeze right before it happens you would need to pop it earlier to reduce being slowed or later to try and escape. 

Characters weaker against-
Orisa - Orisa doesn't move much anyway and you couldn't wait out the fortify to just freeze her and head shot. Creates more of a skill matchup
Road hog - you wouldn't be able to keep freezing him and headshotting until he does one on one in what used to be the longest battles ever. 
Dva - she would still be able to fly away when she needed to and you couldn't just freeze he so the team can focus her down. 
Bastion - if you manage to get close you won't be able to just freeze him as he runs
Reaper (maybe) - this would increase your ability to kite him, but you wouldn't be able to finish him off as easily when caught with wraith form on cooldown

Synergies - this would make her work really well with slower healers like zenyatta and Ana as you would be better able to help defend them. It would also help a lot with accuracy based heroes as you would be able to slow enemies in brawls and better allow them to line up shots. 




Maintaining her identity as a character - Mei is supposed to be a lovable character fighting for the greater good. By slowly lining up an icicle through the skull she has developed more of an evil reputation. With this change she would be more of a protector and less "devil incarnate". 
This would also further her role at higher levels as a crowd control character as it would make the slow useful instead of only using the icicles for damage. Her focus would be on maintaining the tempo of combat. All the great uses with ice wall would remain 
The change would also have a big effect on her ult. It would make those moments where the enemy is frozen all the more exciting since you don't freeze with your normal attack. It would also encourage more follow up from Mei to slow enemies from running out of the affected area. The freeze time on the ult might need to be slightly reduced to compensate, but if that were the case you would have an ult that is more effective when planned ahead where you can slow them before they escape, and it would be less effective to just throw out and use ice block as you wait for enemies to freeze. I always hated this tactic on 2 cp to stall. 


Overall effect on the meta - this would all depend on how the numbers are tweaked. I think it would definitely be a step in the right direction though. It would give Mei a more unique role in the game. It would be the only true way to counter lucio and would make accuracy based characters more useful when she is in play both as a synergy and as her counter. Grouping and communication would be far more vital for her to be effective. 
If this Mei became meta I think you would see more mccree, Orisa, widow, hanzo, rein, Ana, and zen


Bonus point 1 : her primary was mostly used for killing enemies before where now it would be more about crowd control. It makes more sense to switch left and right click, which many Mei players do anyway. 

Bonus 2: this change to Mei would further open up to the possibility of a character with an aoe cleanse as a strong counter... maybe a new healer to add to the roster...

How to land ana shots onto an enemy genji?
Hey first time poster on this subreddit. When I duel genjis I know how to hit sleep darts on them, however, I don't know when it is best/how to hit them with my unscoped rifle shots. Thanks for the helpQuick scope. It makes it way easier. 
Ah ok, whenever I tried to duel them with scoped shots I would make myself an easier target. So I shouldn't just straight up scope but instead quickscope?

Elo Hell? Need Advice On Climbing
Hi there.

Recently I've been having a lot of issue rising out of Gold. I've done it a few times -- I was Platinum in Season 4 or 5...but recently I've found that nothing I do helps me consistently win and rise up the rankings. I've tried going support, but then teammate tanks and DPS fail to secure space or eliminate targets enough for us to break a choke or stop an attack. I've tried staying on tank, but then supports pocket a DPS or for some reason they position themselves across the map from me. I've tried DPSing, but I can only kill the people I can, and some matches are better than others. It seems like no matters where I position myself or what I flex into, there's huge gaps in game sense from everyone else. I've tried bridging that with other teammates, but of the 2 or 3 people that go into voice chat, no one seems to want to work together. No one wants to focus one target at a time, choosing to kill whoever is in front of them. No amount of coddling seems to get any teams to want to work together...and honestly at this moment I'm frustrated and at a loss of what to do. For everyone win I manage to get, I get two losses. I understand that this is a team game, but when I'm trying to rise up with uncooperative, unhelpful teammates...I just don't understand what I can do to improve anything. I'm sure that my frustrations are echoed by a lot of people here. Perhaps if someone who was able to deal with this and still rose has any tips or anything I can do to help, that would benefit me.

As an aside, I haven't discounted that the common element in all of these matches -- me -- could be why I'm not rising. But through VOD coaching and my general consistency in playing, I've been told by more than one person in Masters+ that I should be much higher than I currently am.

  At first I thought this would be a salty gold player complaining about teammates, but reading further I can see it's not that. Unlike others who write these posts, you aren't putting everything down to your teammates. 

What have you changed? My advice is to not go support. Go dps or tank at least. Try to queue with friends. After three losses, stop playing. 

But possibly the best tip is unfortunately just to get good. Don't have master players say you should be plat or higher. Have the game say you should be plat or higher. The thing players call elo hell is more like elo swamp. You're not stuck down there, but it slows things down. You'll climb much less per session than you should, but you'll still climb. 

The last point I have is something I don't think you need. Elo hell is a mindset, which holds you back. It tilts you quicker, makes you triggered by the hero select screen. You see a torb on your team, and you think that's just elo hell making the game unwinnable. That's why I hate it when people talk about elo hell being real, because they are the ones causing it.
this.

How is this even possible as Genji?
https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/6yynrn/most_satisfying_way_to_end_a_dragonblade/

How the fuck is he slashing so quickly? Not only do i count more than 7 slashes, but i swear to god some of them are like .5 seconds apart?!?!Essentially he animation cancels the swing animation by dashing, that's why it appears that he's swinging more than 7 times, but it looks legit
Genji does a similar animation with his dash as his ult. There's a slight visual difference though.
Genji's dash attack resets back to being ready to use again whenever Genji gets a kill.

When you ultimate as Genji, you can get quite a few kills, meaning your dash cooldown resets several times. It looks like Genji is slashing a lot in this killcam because some of the slashes are actually dash attacks.
Genji main here. That's normal. I do that all the time. Go watch Necros. 
Does the slash still do damage? Can i slash, immediately dash, immediately slash again, and hit both slashes?
Yes.
:O

Requesting VOD review- aim wise
Hi, a few weeks ago I was able to play at decent/sub-par accuracy as tracer. However, over the past few days I have been trying to tweak my sens as I felt that my current sensitivity was making aim a little shaky than normal. So after experimenting for quite a while I realised that I probably should stick to my old sens as I was accustomed to it. However, as I switched back, the shaky problem when aiming got even worse. I assume its due to all those tweaks I did which messed up somewhere but I'm not sure where. 

Below are two links that I would like reviews on how i can improve my aim and possible solutions to these problems I'm facing. 

Link 1 (initial aim where it wasn't shaky): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWqr0wDbkFE&list=PLZ707pe6SNMCKfrtpxfHbSA_kbWZy_CI1


Link 2 (after tweaks which made it worse IMO): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhAejpyjhbk


Edit: my current sens/dpi is 3.8/1600
Did i deserve my losingstreak?
I dropped from 3500 to 2600 Sr. I earned the 3.5k rating through 5 seasons now im back to where i was back in season 2 but at the same time i can maintain mid diamond while practicing heroes on my alt account. I dont tilt much so i really dont know if its my fault or not that i had this losing streak. What can i do to climb out because regardless of what i play if my team loses it loses so hard you can literally not carry.
How long was the losing streak over? Like over a day, you probably should have stopped after a certain number of losses... 
1 week in season 5 and 3-4 days in season 6


Stuck in gold, want to get to plat. Any advice useful
Hello all. I am a mid gold player that has been fluctuating between 2200 and 2300 (though I dipped just yesterday to 2100 and I am climbing again back to where I was. Plat is just in reach but every time I get close, I just fall back down again. I know that I probably should be in gold, but I just want some advice so how I improve so I can rank up.Just recently made plat after a year of playing. I recommend watching some strategy videos on YouTube and being more thoughtful when you play. You have to evaluate every decision you make and know your role. I main zenyatta and focusing on my positioning has done wonders. 
Ever had a "insert hero here" player on the other team that just destroys your team? Friend them, then duo queue. That's basically how i went from 2300-2500. Now sitting at 3100.
Work around your team, be the voice of reason,  and play comp like a quick play. When I stopped letting the pressure of "competitive" get to me I got way better
I'm also a Zen main clocking in at 3585 (I also play other support/tank heroes), if you send me a VOD I can help you out :)
I have been doing that for a while and I also main zen. There is only so much I can do as I am one man. I try to improve but when your team is trickling and getting killed off, its hard to climb. I also have myself to blame as my aim is not the worst but could be better.

Nice Zen mains 4 life. Accuracy is another thing I've been working on a lot. Some video said to try and keep it above 40% so that's why I try to do. Staying calm and picking my shots in close encounters instead of firing as fast as possible has helped a lot. Also, do you talk? Even if no one else is on their mic it's amazing how much people will listen if it sounds like you know what you're doing. The first time I told someone to stop rushing in, and they did, I was shocked! 

You're probably doing all of that already too. Anyway, good luck!

EDIT: And work on your Alt Fire!! I didn't use it for my first 80 hours or w/e. It's awesome 
Set your dps up for success. 

Did your Genji just pull out his blade? Is he going in on anything that can ruin his day? (Mccree, Winston, Roadhog, etc) Transcendence and join him unless its a guaranteed won fight. This one is tricky though, you generally want to make sure you have a Mercy, Symmetra TP or Lucio because if the enemy Genji decides to pull his blade out next, you're going to need a defensive ult or wipe insurance, hence the other 3 heroes. Ana doesn't have a defensive ult.

Take a peek at who your dps are shooting. Discord that target and help with orbs. Focus firing is ridiculously overpowered if you can do it right. Even in mid diamond I think focus fire is the number one controllable reason for win/loss. 

Have a friend or make a friend who can run a Genji or Tracer and do some 1v1 scenarios. You won't win many, you shouldn't win many. But being able to successfully stay alive an extra 3 times out of 10 and maybe win once or twice can make or break a match, specially during overtimes. This will also help you play under pressure.


I do talk and try to keep the team together but some people just don't like it. I love alt fire and definately will try to pick my shots

this.
What?

Deathmatch matching with people 2k SR more.
Lately in deathmatch, the matchmaking doesn't seem to be working properly. I am a (mid-high) gold player. In deathmatch however I keep being matched with High diamond-Grandmaster players. If im at 2.2k SR, how can they match me wih 4.3k SR players?

[Example](https://imgur.com/a/5tOqK)Deathmatch has its own set of skills specific to that mode, I wouldn't worry to much about the enemy SR
My SR is around 4.2-4.3. I find it confusing when there are gold-diamonds in DM. They are just essentially getting farmed by the GMs, and it becomes a race to who can hit 20 by ignoring the other GMs. I don't understand the arguments made by others here that they belong there - they don't. It's just that there are not enough GMs queuing.
Dm has a split mmr from qp and comp.  You will sometimes get new Dm players that are high elo. 

Furthermore if you are getting higher skilled players in your games , it means your skills are getting into the higher elo ranges. This is a good thing. It shows that your mechanics are improving and you will face harder opponents.

Be glad you're fighting high skilled players because you might join them soon. 
it's not a whole lot of fun playing with silvers as a masters player either, i gotta say
The heros they play is almost irrelevant. I'm low diamond and I played against a gm in dm who picked mercy and got second place(i got second XD). I had to ignore the mercy as pharah because she would kick my ass half the time. Next game the same dude picks reaper and got first place no problem, (I think I was third)

I had one game with the junkrat streamer pvp. He was top 500 last season and oh shit. I don't even remember that game because I was dead. I got last place and it wasn't even enjoyable. When I looked through my social that match had 2 top 500s and a couple gms
I actually like coming up against very high ranked players as it's great practice, but this sucks when you are in just for a couple casual relaxing games trying out heroes you don't usually play.
When I come 6th-8th every game because I keep getting rekt by GMs frustrates me. I need to play against higher level people to improve, but they shouldn't be so much higher that I can't do anything.
This is a lame response to this problem. I'm low plat and have been in an FFA match with two top 500's. Matches with multiple people master and gm, etc. It is zero fun to try to play against people who are measurably significantly better at the game than you. (I should also note I often see low\mid gold in these very same matches, those poor bastards)

Just because the skill set for FFA is different (and yeah, it really is different) people who are 1000-2000 SSR better than you are always going to be better mechanically and with game sense... or you'd usually be the same rank.

The queue time for FFA (for me anyway) is usually under 30 seconds. I would GLADLY wait several minutes if it had a good chance of not being an unbalanced crapfest.

The way most matches like this go are pretty much Blizzard sponsored bullying.
i was curious if high ranked people thought like this but yeah, it feels like this. it feels like the both high ranked genjis ignore each other and kill the third between them, throw a few shuriken at each other and then they see the mccree who dared to throw a flash at one genji, and bam, next kill
yeah, no offense but a 4+ ana is better than my shitty 3k sombra (best hero) or any other hero i obviously play like platinum. its sometimes incredible to see a master support player playing a DPS and crushing me. its just strange, i get it, somehow we are all in the same game but it never feels right. its not even that i look into the stats, just when that genji could steal my kill and kill me again i look up and see the higher rank and i ask myself "what should i have done better to not die", so i learn something, but its frustrating as fuck
I guess I play DM for different reasons, I'd love to practice against t500s, and I don't care if I'm in the top 4 that much. 
I do have to agree that having a range of skills in a game is great for learning. As a low plat, playing against diamonds is a great learning experience a lot of the time.

Playing against GMs just makes me feel like shit most of the time. Their reaction speed and accuracy is just so much better that its no fun. Especially when they are shitting on you and you see that its on a hero they have <10 hours on and you are playing a main with 100~ hours. Demoralizing.
Same here. At least it will just be hitscans and Genjis instead of all junkrats and doomfists.

How do you even win when on defense?
I have played 28 games of payload pushing and have lost on defense every single time. How do you even play this game when your guaranteed to lose half the time? The team comps according to the game seems to be fine but every time I play on defense I lose. If I go on offense I win 99% of the time but on defense I have not won a round yet? How do you properly play defense?In my experience with playing defence, you need a lot more coordination and communication than playing offence. I also find myself playing defence characters or even healers much more aggressively than if I was on offense, so perhaps the best defense is a good offense?
Yes the passive play is my biggest frustration with the game. "They're getting close to us fall back and group up!" all the way to the endzone.

High K:D ratio but mediocre elims/dmg - should I be more aggressive?
Hi all

This season I am semi-maining McCree and I am running a 3.38 K:D ratio but finding that I'm racking up noticeably less elims and damage per game than I did last season. I think it's because I have climbed in SR enough to find myself in danger a lot more than last season, and I'm wondering whether I should play more aggressive to increase my elims and damage or maintain the high K:D ratio because being dead is problematic?

I know ultimately what matters is that I win games, but lately I have been feeling a bit ineffective even though my K:D ratio is high. Play more and you ll find your playstyle  it won t hurt to try to be aggressive tho 
I'm on the side of do what you can but don't die(because if you're dead then youre not doing anything). 

That said you want to push the envelope and not play too safe. 

Think to yourself if you advance on a more aggressive positioning what can the enemy do to deal with you and make you back down. If they do that then what is your escape route to get back into position to continue dealing damage. 

In short: Anytime you take an aggressive position know why you're doing it and how you'll react to the enemies trying to shut you down. 
Grind it out in the ffa deathmatch game mode. You'll get better at being aggressive. 
Well just try to feel flow of the match, if you have very good team you can be more agressive, yolo and experiment, if you have medium but solid team, play it safe. If you have very bad team and nothing works, try to go for sneaky flanks and YoLO hoping to get some surprise 1:3 kills and change flow of the game. Also remember to check Kill-Feed, can make your decisions based on that, especially when you have picks. 
Skyline has a mentality about aggression that I'd agree with. (He places top500 with support when he wants, he's amazing)

You want to play too aggressive at first every game to see how aggressive you can be. If you play it safe to start with, you never know what aggression level you can get away with. The best way to find the fine line, is to push it over the edge once.

This is hard to concentrate on in a game but I'll do it sometimes. It drives me nuts when we're on attack and right off the bat people are like 'OK PLAY SAFE BE CAREFUL'  Fuck that! it's attack, we can just respawn! Every attackers first push should be an all in brawl just to see if it works lol. 
best way to know to be more aggressive or not is to put yourself in dangerous situations (something like tracer) and see how long you can survive alone if you start instantly losing health keep practicing and if you survive a few seconds without healer or if you don't lose health really fast than you should play aggressively. if that's hard or challenging for you there's second solution. so if you go alone/lone wolf play style play aggressively or if you go with your team play little more defensively. hope this helped you 
Nothing matters more than winning. If your win rate is higher than 55%, don't change anything.
This. Coach Seksi recommends this approach too, with ZENYATTA. You need to test how much of a positional advantage the opponent is willing to give you, you'll be surprised how much you can get away with. By attempting aggressive plays, you achieve 2 things: you are able to detect other flankers attempting to do the same thing and you can draw the oppositions attention away from the main fight, increasing your teams chances of winnng the main fight. Note that this only really works in solo competitive, against coordinated six stacks, you have to be more careful.

I'm super shaky when the fight gets close to me, how can I change this?
As mentioned in the title, I've noticed that my close range combat is sorely lacking. My aim is relatively decent for distances, but if anyone enters like a 5m radius around me I shake like crazy and can't track them. Also, before anyone mentions it, my sense is already quite low (I'm not able to check my computer right now so I don't recall my sensitivity settings) and I've tried lowering them more, which only makes my overall aim worse.

To get a sense of how bad it is, I'll give an example of my McCree play in DM as I've been trying him a lot recently. I've been able to come second with 19 kills (so close!) as him on maps like Volskaya where there are big open spaces to track from afar, but when I get maps like Château Guillard with lots of cramped corridors, I've finished with literally 0 eliminations. 

I essentially think my problem is that I lowkey panic when people get too close to me so then I just start spraying and praying, but obviously that isn't working out for me.

So I suppose I'm wondering if anyone has some thoughts or tips and tricks that I could use to improve my close-range gameplay?

Thanks ahead of time!

Ps. Sorry if there are any formatting errors, I typed this on my phone.I'm in the same boat, not as much with shaky aim as crap aim. I think I just tend to assume that I have to make my shot as soon as possible, which is probably true some of the time, but I'd bet most of the time I've got a bit more leeway on reactions than I think. My advice would to be just slow down and breathe, maybe you die, but it's just a game
In DM, don't worry about elimination think about the fight. If you die that's fine. Try to keep that mindset. After you die really think about what they were doing and what was going on in your mind during that encounter. If their are too many people bail and find a 1v1 you can just work on close quarters maneuvering. 

Just practice that one thing over and over without worrying about anything else until you can slow down your mind in those situations and not panic. It's DM, no one is going to get mad at you.

If you're focused on practicing close quarters fighting only you can't focus on winning so don't worry about the score board. Go into the game knowing you're not winning that one.
8 or 9 years back at the height of TF2's  popularity I suffered terribly from performance anxiety (lol) and nervousness during close encounters as well. My best advice is to just play through it. It my be daunting and frustrating but don't stop grinding at locking in your close range game. 
You get to a point where you can sink back, asses, and have confidence in your abilities and reaction speeds. 
I put around 5k hours into TF2. Nothing tremendous, but I got anxious up until around the 2k hour mark. That's when I had my aha moment for PC FPS and suddenly all I saw was the code like Neo (in a fanciful way lmao) but I'm trying to describe a sense of something so bear with me. 
I'll dance toe to toe down hallways McCree vs McCree now and it's just another kill (or death) but usually a kill ;)  Hopefully you get to cut your teeth soon and start ending lives with face punches 
I would recommend practicing with tracer. She forces you to get up close and fight but her flashback gives you the ability to get out fast if youre not doing very well. Its great practice. 

I started playing her and notice that I dont get as scared when a symmetra or another tracer comes up to me. 
What helped me the most was just telling myself over and over "if you rush your shots you'll miss and lose, if you take that split second to aim you'll get them". Helped me get a lot better at getting genjis and tracers as a s76. 

Learning not to panic shoot takes time. My gut was always spray and pray like you mentioned. 
Who do you typically play as? That can change how you should react to some things. 
Go to DM and try to engage close fights as much as you can. Once you'll get used to it you won't panic anymore. Each time you 'd be in such situation after that it will be like "oh, as usual, I know what to do, I did it 1000 times, nothing special about this one".
I have this issue too, with Hog no less, and to a worse extent Orisa. When a Genji gets up in my face im not quite sure what to do. He just does backflips around me.
To practice close i have 2 suggestions. 
1 play zarya or tracer in training range to practice close up range tracking/ get used to being close  (moving bots) 

2 play them in deathmatch/ qp and practice and make an effort to play in your weak points

Low charge zarya takes good aim to track while tracer is all about being close
Play tanks for a while. You get used to being up in the enemy's face pretty quickly.
force self to stop tensing up took me months to stop for reasons. also you are probs grippping mouse hella tight.
Breathe in, Breathe in, Breathe out.
As others have said, the beautiful thing about Death match is you can engage into these specific scenarios over and over quickly, with much less at stake if you lose the fight. Practice it and build a rythym. It's a different skill set than mid/long range shots so you have to treat it like it's own thing
Acctually, having an low sens makes harder to fight up close in my opinion

I use higher sens when playing heroes like Lúcio, Genji, Reaper and Tracer...

An good thing to improve on this is going to QP on Genji and bully the sups, no need to fast killing, just keep shooting and avoiding them...

And of course, the best way to improve is keep doing close combats, the more you do, easier it gets
I'm not high-ranked but at my level, the only 1v1 opponents I'm not fully sure about are competent Junkrat and Pharah. Any other characters I floor if I meet them 1v1. But I used to be like you, panic-adrenaline rush whenever anything gets close-quarter (I used to main Ana).

Try learning Mei. Switch left and right mouse button so she's basically like a beefy projectile McCree. She's beefy (250 hp) so it's more forgiving when your reaction speed goes down bc of panic, and there's always a panic button if you are caught in a tight corner (shift).

Practice with TDM instead of FFA DM because it's more forgiving. (Everyone else is a decoy and you'll have more secure 1v1)

1. Start with scavenging (jumping out of corner, freeze and headshot the enemies flanking/running away). This is a low-key, low-pressure no-surprise 1v1 you initiate by sensing the enemy by the sound and waiting ahead. Roadhog, McCree, or Doomfist abilities can be ignored if you use the cryo at the right timing. This will build you some confidence.

2. The next step is to learn how to jump and strafe around the enemy to avoid getting hit while freezing. You can improvise and even jump over the enemy while freezing. Other characters can't slow enemies like her, but the steady aim, composure, and evasion skill transfers to other characters. (Especially completely freezing and nailing the icicle exactly on the head, and an additional melee combo)

3. The next is initializing the encounter with an icicle upfront. If you land the first shot correctly the enemy will panic (especially the headshot) and you'll know you can finish the job. If you know for sure you can make enemy panic, you will do so less.

4. Go unleash some meihem. Give a jumpscare, chase after enemy with tracking aim icicles, block their escape route with a wall (looking at you Reaper) - let them (and yourself) know that you own the 1v1 arena. You don't have to be completely comfortable with 1v1s; just learn how to make it as uncomfortable as possible to the enemy character (not only with Mei, but with any other characters. Like Winston dropping on top of the head). The less shaken person almost always wins.

extra. Try confronting Pharah in TDM. Doesn't have to be 1v1 (in fact, have a few teammates around who act as decoys), but it's one hell of a prediction flick shot practice in panic. Three body shot or one headshot one body shot can silence her, but can you do that before Pharah senpai notices you, especially if she's ulting? (hint, if at first you don't succeed, try, try again - but don't spray and pray at Pharah because it gives you a bad panic habit. If you don't land the shots you die, no biggies.)
either practice the big flicks you need to hit to track at close ranger or increase your sensitivity a little
I know this will sound weird but listen to some music while you play. SoundCloud has some great chill playlists which if you have a discord server with a bot you can just practice and chill. It gets you in a more relaxed mood but still let's you focus if you need. Another thing, take your time. If you're playing McCree don't hold LMB. If you're playing soldier 76, don't just burst fire every .5 second. Burst fire when you know your cross hair is in their player model. Take your time and relax, trust me, soon you'll be double dinking a genji as McCree like nothing.

Chew gum. Tricks your brain into thinking you are eating and therefore safe. Helps keep my breathing and heartrate in check. 
I think a good aim practise is to just go slow and make sure you hit. Aiming fast to clutch is all well and good, but you have to have a level of consistency to pull it off. I'd liken it to playing the piano. Maybe not the best way to learn, but when I learned I'd just start by playing a song slowly with minimal mistakes all the way through, then slowly start speeding up. Hope that helps!
Sounds more like a medical condition??  Are you prone to seizures?
Become a Winston main.
Stop being a puss. Its a game
Yeah I think this is mostly it. I was just getting really good with hogs slow shots by slowing down and really thinking about aiming them, but then he got reworked and I'm back to square one haha.
This sounds pretty logical, I'll try it out. Thanks!
Haha sounds good. This is pretty much all I play so I'll get there eventually!
Thats a good idea! I actually got pretty decent as tracer because I played her for the legendary difficulty of the standard version of the uprising event. Perhaps I've just not kept it up, as she is one of my least played heros in the game.
Yeah, like I mentioned in another comment, I too got to the point where I could slow down and nail those shots with old hog, but just as I got the hang of it, he got changed.
I play a lot of heroes haha, I go in phases in terms of who I do well with and enjoy playing, so I've mained someone different every season pretty well. In comp I've mained Zen/mercy, ana/soldier, winston/dva, hog, as well as flexing a fair amount. I pretty much like to play anyone in the game except genji and df... I suck at those two for pretty much the same reason in my post lol.
Sounds good! I'm getting the vibe that my solution is simply: play more in that situation and practice haha.
While spamming "mada mada" probably
I do play tanks, my top 10 most played in all modes consist of 4 tanks, 4 healers, and 2 dps lol
To be honest I don't think even tried Mei in DM yet. I'll give her a shot, see what happens!
Hahaha I would not have thought of anything like this.
This makes sense, as a music player I can relate. Thanks for the input!
Haha no I'm not, I guarantee its not that. As other people and myself have guessed its more just panicking and losing my calm.
Haha Winston is one of my most confident tanks to play, but I still lose track of people and shake with him. 
Go play 24 DM games and practice your aim. Consider lowering your sensitivty a little 
Recording those games may help so you can analyze the fights you lost later
First off, warm up with some stuff before you play. aimbooster.com is a great place to start and you can do drills and mini games that can keep you under pressure. Learning to deal with that pressure is key, as it will transfer to multiple places in games. 

Another thing that will help with it is to avoid it in comp. Unless you're choosing a hero who's made for finishing off a low-health enemy, stick to your team and call out help when you need it. Until you become confident in your ability to 1v1, you're a liability to the team when you're on your own. 

The confidence will rise as you start focusing and working on flaws in your play style. Don't expect it to change overnight, or even the following week. It's about progression. Start with the site I mentioned, then the shooting range, then some custom games where you are facing 6 bots by yourself, move to QP, and then slowly incorporate into your comp game. Do this with EVERY hero you play with. You'll have to learn first hand with your own settings how each individual hero feels at different distances. I've personally found playing custom games against bots with only headshots to really help my aim, especially with a tracer or two on the other team. But honestly, nothing beats real-world experience. Use arcade mode and QP to further your skills before it gets to where it matters in comp.

As for now, if you want to climb and win, stick to what you know best and cooperate with your team. Lean on them, allow them to lean on you, and make each other better. 

As always, look up some guides/VOD reviews and see what people are being critiqued on. I highly recommend OneAmongstMany on YT. He covers a ton of stuff in many videos, including positioning, situational awareness, teamwork, etc. Start recording your play and putting them up on the sub. There's plenty of people out there looking to help others! 
Always.
Oh, okay. Are you talking about nerves or just difficulties aiming? Because it is more difficult to hit a target when it's right in front of you and jumping around.
No problem. :) The key (heh) is to get it right first, then get it right fast. 
Oh I only paid attention to the title and thought you meant like full-body shaking not as in twitchy aim
Shaking won't matter with him, if the enemy is on screen and near you, you'll hit them. 
Thanks for the input! Perhaps I'll check out that site, and some VODs and whatnot.
To be honest its probably a bit of a combination of the two. between losing track of them and not being able to even hit them because I rush my shots and whatnot.
No worries, It happens! I'd be worried too if somebody was shaking all over.
This is true.

How do i improve my aiming (and in general)
Level 105 Gold player here (2247 rn) 

I really struggle with all forms of aiming, both tracking and flicking, although id say soldier is my strongest DPS by far. Ive been trying to lower my sense, train in practice range, train with ana bots, watching aim guides as much as i can, playing with crosshairs and i still feel like im always going to be stuck in gold 

I get on the voice chat every game, and think that on the whole my positioning with most heroes is good. I try my best to keep track of enemy ults and to combo my own with my team. 

What do i do to improve, am i just being way too impatient or is there something ive missed? 
Rewatch your gameplay. Just start out slow asking yourself am I in the right place, who should i focus, where is my team, etc. (If you do not know what to ask watch Iostux's coaching video. ) Write your mistakes down then work on that. Work on it piece by piece like Positioning then Targeting. I know the struggle bro I climbed from 2199 to 2790 i used dis to git gud. 
cheers, how would you recommend rewatching gameplay? 

And will rewatching my gameplay help me aim? 


How can I have mechanical aim like the pros?
Hey guys, I'm looking for someway to make my aim go above and beyond. What kind of practices would you recommend to make it like the pros. The pro dps players seems to lock on to players like aimbots its amazing.

I just don't't seem to get how they do that so well. Am I missing something or do I just need to keep practicing?Play more
Practice.
Bro. You are asking how can you play football as good as x professional player. Well, if you *dedicate* your life to playing, maybe you will develop a godly aim. Is it worth it? Not unless you really really want to become a pro player, an even then it's questionable.
Take [this advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlCRfTmBSGs9) from Fatal1ty (one of the most famous pros in gaming ever).
While a majority of the playerbase has the potential to get into the higher ranks with the proper mentality and effort put into it, pros usually play at a level way above that, which can only be reached by years of practice and by being young enough.

Unless you're exceptionally talented or have great genetics, you'll simply never have the aim of a 16-20 year old guy who has been playing fps for the last 5-10 years if say, you're 25-30 now. That is, if you don't have the background yet, and aren't young enough, by the time you'd get the amount of practice that's needed, you'll be simply old enough that your performance degrades.

If you're 15-20, go play a lot, the world is yours!

A small note at the end, even if your condition would reasonably prevent you from from making it in the pro scene, there's no reason not to improve if you enjoy the game. The majority wouldn't ever do anything if this wasn't the case.
Ok so I would say I have a good aim, but it comes from playing over 1000h of quake and 500h of csgo, my main is Ana with over 350h.
So to answer your question play fps games a lot, and try to use the same sensitity over games(there are a lot of tools to calculate your cm/360° try to have the same in all games).
And don't try to practice aim against bots, it will only make you worse because they don't act like players.
Play a lot more. They've been playing FPS games for thousands of hours.
Git gud.
Lower sensitivity, practice tracking, profit.
Don't expect any quick solutions but 'just practice' is really not helpful advice...

You should always be trying to keep track of your strengths and weaknesses and put time into improving those weaknesses. If your aim on close range targets is bad, do something to practice bigger flicks (eg go stand close to some of the moving training bots in the practice range and try to track them properly). If you struggle to make the accurate micro movements that are needed to hit moving targets at long range, try to improve your micro hand control. You could do that by playing a different game with a relatively high sensitivity (I've done this with osu recently and it's helped quite a bit) or you could just set up long range tracking drills.

A few people including Sayaplayer use Aim Hero on steam to practice their aim and it seems to have generally decent reviews, it's not free but it's cheap so you can look into that to see if it will help you.

I guess the short answer is 'structured practice' but reading the comments in this thread could mislead someone into thinking that you can brainlessly play first person shooters for ten thousand hours and get pro level aim. As a former tf2 player who regularly played against pubbers with multiple thousands of hours who still had trash aim, I know that's most certainly not the case. You gotta keep pushing yourself if you want to get better at things, aiming is no exception.
if you arent born with it thousands of hours of practice.
At that level, you're born with it, and then improved over years of practice. The vast majority of OW pros played other FPS games for years before OW even existed.  Unless you're literally  born with a god tier natural talent, then OW will have run it's course before you have enough time to get that good.
it's genetics mainly + time. if you don't have the genetics no amount of time will get you to pro level. 

EDIT: i love how i am getting downvoted by people who think anybody can become pro at something simply by putting in time. If that were true every kid who wanted to be in the NBA would be there. Same goes for pro gaming. Wake up people
this.

Anyone else never experienced the "placed lower than my last season sr" issue?
A lot of people would say they get placed in an sr lower than what they were last season, but this isn't the case for me. Since season 1, my sr season high has been increasing everytime I get placed. I don't play competitive much, I only do placements (seaaon 4 and 5 were exceptions). I want to know if I'm just doing really good or people exaggerate over about being placed lower than their last season SR.

Season 1: placed at 60, current was 59.

Season 2: season high and current above 2600s.

 Season 3: placed 2796 sr     

During those seasons I played Reinhardt mostly.           

 Season 4: placed somewhat high 2800s, went on a rollercoaster to get to diamond, season high was 3055 sr decayed to 3000. Played mostly mercy.                    

 Season 5: won 7 out of 10 games, placed 3074, lost 5 games getting me to 2986, took a few weeks of break, played 1 one game which luckily got me a win, got to 3026 then decayed 3000. I kinda flexed? It was a mix healers, d.va and a little bit of roadhog/zarya.            

 Season 6: just finished my last few placements hours ago, I lost 7 games out of 10 and yet I got an sr of 3200s, pretty much popped my eyes out when I saw that. I flexed between playing tanks (mostly roadhog and d.va) and dps (I did really good as 76/junkrat, sadly i played them only when being stomped as a tank, so it was too late to win even if I was the only dps on fire during these games), only played healers in 2 games.

I want to know if I'm just doing pretty good, or people are exaggerating over the placement system. Or maybe it's just my luck. I also want to know if anyone actually gets placed higher every season.i got placed 3.1 last season was at 3k if that counts for anything
You're probably just getting better. For me on the other hand... S1: 51, S2: high gold, S3: mid gold... And this continued until today where I find myself in silver, trying my best but no clue how to climb even though my stats are decent. 
> I don't play competitive much, I only do placements (seaaon 4 and 5 were exceptions)

That is (probably) the reason why. Because you have a small amount of games, the matchmaker isn't sure yet where you belong. So if you do well in the games you play, it thinks you belong higher and so it places you higher each season.

Personally I placed a bit lower every new season than where I finished the season before.

S1: placed around 50, season high 61, ended 57.

S2: placed low Platinum, season high 3087, ended 2862.

S3: placed 2829, season high 3690, ended 3676.

S4: placed 3423, season high 3968, ended 3873.

S5: placed 3778, season high 3974, ended 3825.

S6: not placed yet.

Edit: but this season it's not rare to place higher than where you were before, if we can believe the multiple people reporting that.

Occasionally there were reports similar to yours but definitely not the norm.  Did you play a lot of qp and do well?  Could explain it.
I placed 2756 after ending last season at 2666 but this season is the only season that's happened to me in. I played really well in my placement matches and was on fire a lot of the time so that probably has to do with it.
i think swing of +/- 500 points after placements is fairly common, haven't heard anyone to fluctuate more than that. 
Don't you think it's kinda...too much? Don't get me wrong I feel proud that I jumped from a season high of 3074 to 3277 sr immediately but that's a 200 sr difference, I even lost 7 games too, I don't know, I always think the system considers the win and loss result over the performance. 
I barely play quick play anymore, played lots of mystery heroes but I've been getting stomped when enemy has 2 winstons and bastions while we get squishies so I stopped. I play custom games now and 3v3 for quick weekly rewards (where I play healer mostly to get it over with). Even then, I still did better with my 76 and junkrat than my instalock dps teammates in my comp matches, being on fire and stuff and actually getting kills.


I need help with my aim
I have really good aim for my level, but also really low crit acc, what are some ways to hit more headshots? Also, I miss a lot of close rang McCree and soldier shots but do fine at midrange to long range, how do I  improve that?You could do conscious headshot practice in deathmatch or QP until it's natural to go for the head for you. As for the close range what sens do you use? Shooting people up close can be harder for people with lower sensitivities, but you don't want to change it and have it mess up your medium-long range accuracy just needs time and practice. 
Croasair placement, try to have your crossair at head level(where you think the enemies head will be) when peaking corners, this will make you have to move your mouse less if even at all to hit a headshot... 
Otherwise it's just practice
Put your cross hair to headshot height and aim with the left stick. Obviously only works if you're a console player.
I use 4/1600. I know that's a bit high, I used to play on 3/1600, and this has worked a bit better at all ranges. Should I go up more maybe?
I wouldn't change any higher personally. I play Tracer as my main DPS so I mostly play close range and use a lower sens. I think it just requires practice. You could also be getting nervous because you're aware of yourself lacking in closer ranges. 

Same as headshots just do some DM and really focus on landing your shots. It will get progressively easier for you and thus it'll become more second nature at all ranges. 

When I was practicing McCree a couple of seasons ago that's what I did is slow myself down at first and then as I got better I would naturally flick to targets faster and thus shoot faster but when I started I didn't fire as fast as I could I waited for my shot to line up. 
Thank you, I'll give it a shot.
Yup this, slow down and aim for accuracy, death match helped heaps esp for strafe +aiming which is essential
What's your sens/dpi for tracer? Mine is 3.7/1600, so you think it's too much?
It's only too high if it's not giving you results. I keep my sens/dpi the same across all heroes but typically adjust by what I'm mostly playing it's a little higher ATM because I'm playing support mostly right now. When I mained Tracer I used 800/3.4 but now I'm using 800/5.2(this sens still feels good on her for me though). 
I tried like lower sens like 2.5/1600 but my aim/cross hair was still shaky, could this be a sens problem or some other factor that I may not be aware of?
Maybe sens. I mean you could go to training field and strafing from left to right while keeping your crosshair on the bots head(without shooting) at various ranges. If you can keep it mostly on their head while moving back and forth your sens is probably pretty solid. 

Ana vs. Dive
Hello everyone. This is my first post on here. But I've been reading and following for a while now. Love the community. Anyways...

I really enjoy playing Ana. Her kit is extremely fun and she's definitely my favorite support to play. However, I don't play Ana in comp because when I get dived by the enemies I feel helpless. Unlike Zen where I stand a strong chance against my attackers. For that reason, I mainly just play her in quick play. 

Once someone commits to taking me out (gengi, tracer, etc.) I feel screwed. I usually panic and start spamming shots. These smaller quick characters are hard for me to land sleeps on. Obviously DVA and Winston are easy to sleep and for that reason I don't struggle with them. But with the quick flankers I just get owned. Is this normal? Or should I be better at fighting these type of characters if I don't have a teammate to help. Or should I not duel them and just try to move back into the middle of my team. 

Obviously, I know her damage was nerfed awhile back and that makes her way less capable of 1v1ing. I guess I'm really just trying to determine who I should be able to hold my own against? 

TL,DR

What matchups should I be able to handle on my own as Ana? (Ex. When I'm in back line and someone jumps me and teammates aren't helping). 
How to survive dive meta as Ana? You don't.

But it definitelly is okay to play her if she's in the right hands. You're on console. Well...you're pretty screwed.  Anyway my biggest tip would be to not spam shots and predict shots instead. Ana has a very slow fire rate. If you miss one shot you'll get punished for it. Thus, it's better to wait a split second before firing to make sure you're actually hitting them. 
6 hours in DM as Ana helped me more then any other practices I've ever had. It's like all you have to do while playing DM is to deal with genji/tracer/pharah/sombra/widow. Non-stop. I just wanted to have some fun and maybe train a bit, but I feel great now playing comp. I feel myself as flanker's nightmare. And I don't feel scared. First of all, I know what to do, I did it so many times. Second, it's just one flanker. C'mon, if I could survive 2 genjis + mccree in DM so many times, I'll be fine dealing with one genji. You can focus on sleep darting first. Just, you know, jump in DM and sleep dart everyone you see. Spray a pillow and run away. It's pretty fun btw. After you 'll get used to it - learn how to fight em. Tbh most of them act the same way - you won't waste nade on Tracer who didn't recall yet, or let genji sleep dart you. You'll know what they usually do and you 'll know how to win these mind games.
Good question hopefully you get a good answer. I feel as if I do better with Ana when zoomed in, but that's hard to do with a tracer in your face.
Usually when I miss a sleep dart on a genji or tracer I start bitching at my dps or tanks to come back and help me, or they will be losing heals because I'll be dead. Usually that gets their attention and they come back. I would also recommend staying in the back line, but not staying so far back that you can't get help when you need it. 
You don't. Just today i was playing against an Ana (as Winston) who was hitting every single sleep dart on me. I was really impressed. Still my team won and at the end of the game the other team was saying "report our ana" "didn't heal us once" in chat because she was so preoccupied with me. (On the bright side D Va nerf is coming and new Hog + buffed Reaper are making Winstons a little less common)
Hmm, between bio grenade and sleep dart Ana has great potential for survival when being dove, imo. Save sleep for big targets or last chance flick shots on the smaller targets. Hold grenade untill you take some damage to maximize value.

Honestly, if you are still dying or your team isn't helping you, you may be better off filling the support slot with something less meta. Another healer is an obvious choice, but pros have been known to put in things like torb, Sombra, soldier, even reaper and Mei. Roadhog is even looking like a good choice now. It's all map and team comp dependent, but worth thinking about in hopeless feeling situations. 
No, you DO survive dive. What you can do is to put a lot of effort into keeping track of your enemies behavior and position so you can act accordingly.

Be aware of your surroundings and position yourself where you think the safety-value ratio is best. For example if you saw an enemy flanker disappear from the fight then you are probably already thinking he is coming for you then you either prepare to take him on (most often I advice against it if you can't reliably hit a sleep on a Genji/Tracer) or you go right into your own team if you were far away. 

You draw flankers into far more unfavorable positions for them.
This is fantastic advice. 
Learn by doing, don't shy away from something you want to do but are afraid of the outcome (assuming that thing isn't illegal, etc lol). Play DM, and/or just play her in comp anyway. You can't improve without practice. =D

My duo queue partner is playing worse and worse. How can I help him?
Help! My duo queue partner is playing worse and worse.



Long post incoming

My friend and me, we play video games together for over 6 years, but overwatch is the first game we started playing competitively. I bought the game on release and I convinced my friend to buy it during the Christmas event. Since then we rarely played other games, only overwatch for hundreds of hours. Last season we managed to get a solid rank in platinum (~2700SR). Our placements in S6 have been 5w-5d, so we got placed in the same rank as before. Now whenever I play with my friend, i seem to lose every game. Out of 12 games, we only won 2. Out of my 5 games in solo queue, I won 4. So statistically speaking, he is holding me down and I want to know the reason for this drastic shift. His explanation is that we always get unlucky with teams, but I told him that the only consistencies in all those games are us. "But WE can't be that bad", he told me. I think maybe it has something to do with my changed-up hero pool.

This season I almost completely stopped playing support,  (I used to be an Ana main in S4, in S5 I played mostly tanks) and I try to play more DPS like Tracer (my strongest pick) and Sombra on specific maps.

My friend, on the other hand, used to play dps or Lucio almost every game. Now his dps performance is very inconsistent and instead of Lucio he plays Mercy now (with next to no success, poor positioning and ult usage).  When he plays tanks he tends to feed without getting value for his team. Overall he developed a lack in timing and positioning in general. Further more he doesn't make calls when playing support or tank, which is super counter productive.

I told him multiple times that there is no point in playing support, when you spend half of the game running back from spawn. Instead of mercy, you could be a soldier and be more effective.  

I don't really wanna tell him, that I'd like to play solo from now on, but it seems like I have to decide between gaining SR or playing with my friend. That's a miserable situation I am in and I really could use some advice. Did you ever have similar experiences with your duo queue?With those sample sizes you're not 'statistically speaking'.
Play something with high synergy with him

It will force him to work together with you and you can make the calls in a way that doesn't seem bossy since you are directly involved. 

Did it this season with dva + Winston with great success with my duo. 70% win rate.

Statistically speaking, I wouldn't come to any conclusion just yet.  Don't get tilted just yet.  If you like playing tracer and your friend likes mercy, make sure he understands you will be doing your own thing.  Let him focus on healing the rest of the team.  Also give synergy picks a try.  Anything that can benefit from blue beam is good.  Pharmercy at plat level will usually feel amazing.  Soldier or junkrat is good too.
Do you really speak "statistically" out of 12 and 5 games? Anything could have happened in such a small sample. Just tell him to record his games and you could record your own. Then you could analyse the VODs together and find mistakes, as you will have such too. It will help a lot.
You prefaced this post with "he's the problem..." Sounds like standard finger-pointing to me. Without some form of video to comment on, there is no way to know what is ACTUALLY happening vs your perception of what is happening.

Are you sure you're not stressing him out? If his performance is constantly decreasing, and responds with frequent excuses, that could just be impression management. There is a definite possibility YOU are making him defensive. Do some basic reading on how the stress response affects performance... Social pressures mess you up, man.

Focus on getting better YOURSELF - this will allow you to potentially carry him... or don't carry, and climb anyways; it sounds like this game is far more important to you than him. Nobody here is going to be able to tell you what you need to know to magically fix another human being, and goes far beyond the scope of this subreddit.

If it's important to you, ask him to do some basic reading on overwatch fundamentals, or offer to teach him youself.

Outside of that, the only thing you can change is yourself or the environment. Do you enjoy playing with your friend? If yes, shut up and enjoy spending time together. If no, consider a new partner.
If you really care about ranking up, you could get a second account where you solo queue on. You can still play with your friend on your main and enjoy playing competitively without feeling bad for losing sr.
12 games is not a good sample size.
Don't worry about SR and just play your best. Even if you have to carry him you are going to get better.

Just enjoy the game
> Out of 12 games, we only won 2.

No, you mean that out of 22 games, you only won 7. That's low for sure, but it's entirely possible that you guys got an unlucky streak.

Since the matchmaker tries to line up similarly-sized groups on each team, it's possible that it's not your *skills* that are the problem but rather your *coordination*. If the two man group on the other team is tightly coordinated but the two of you are not, then the other team will likely be more effective than you. 
Also, gaining SR is largely pointless compared to having fun with friends. 
Keep in mind sample size. Anything less than 100 is truly insignificant. Even 100 is mostly insignificant. Anyway what you are doing is mistaking correlation with causation. Why do you lose more games with him? Is it purely just you getting bad luck in the coin flip of competitive. Or is it that your friend is making massive misplays. Or is it you? I play with a friend who smurfs with me quite frequently and I find that I lose more. It's not my friends fault it is me. I play more risky because I know someone has my back if I am caught out. All in all I have to say play more. It may be that they are holding you back but nothing really indicates this. Look for why.
12 games isn't that many. It took me 19 to climb from 2915 (placement) to diamond. 
You're jumping to conclusions. That sample size is way too low to confirm that your teammate is playing badly, although I can guarantee you that if you keep calling them out they will start to do so. Focus on your game.
One other suggestion, in case you can afford it....buy another copy of OW and let it be your "fun" account. That way, it won't bother you at all.  
When playing with a regular partner, you have the benefit of learning how they play and being able to synergize with him.  When you guys changed up your hero pools, you not only lowered your own personal performances(by playing characters you have less experience with), but you also reset the synergy that you had developed.  Now you guys can't really predict each other anymore, because your play styles have changed.

The only way to fix this is to continue playing with each other as you are now.  You'll get better at the heros you added to your pools, and you'll re-learn how your partner thinks.  Your SR will go down during this process, but that's normal.  It will rise back up once you start winning again.  If you want to avoid that initial SR drop, you can play on a secondary account.  Secondary accounts also let you avoid "ladder anxiety".

In my opinion, friendship and enjoyment are more important than your SR.  If you enjoy playing with him, then keep playing with him!
Record the game play of both, try to give each other pointers and discuss it. Try sending it to someone to review and have fun.

Remember that overwatch is just a game to play with a friend. I would dump the game if it costs me a dear friend. Instead of pointing figers on him why u dont help him? 
You have to ask your self, do you care more about your sr or your long time friend?
I'm suprised that nobody told you this already.

TELL HIM TO TAKE A BREAK.

As a Mccree and Tracer main, if I find myself playing just too much I end up being burned up and my perfomance just drops massively.

From what I understood from the post, I take that you only play Overwatch, and that's pretty bad. Try other games together 
I've run into this problem playing with friends before. I've always been able to perform on DPS but when I play with friends I play either support or tank because I know I can play those roles better than they can. I would suggest you to play tank/support when playing with him and just let him dps. Then play dps when you play on your own. The only time I would deviate from this is if your team is severely lacking in dps. Then fuck it, both of you can dps or ask him to go Lucio. 
As others have said, play heroes with high synergy.
I have a lot of success with my duo partner doing this; I play Zarya and he plays Tracer/Reaper. The ult combo potential is amazing, plus I can save him from flashbangs, hooks, and other stuns. 

A few other good duos that we have done; Ana/Soldier (Nanovisor), Pharah/Mercy (obvious duo), and Zarya/Rein (amazing tank synergy).
Experiment play heroes that require teamwork for example tracer/genji and focus same targets or winston / dva or even genji with zen and leave healing on him or tracer / zen.
Also Zarys / Rein or both supports and make lucio be personal guard by protecting you
It sounds like you are playing characters that like to flank and are likely not as close to the team as you were when previously playing support characters.  
 
Now your friend is playing a character that typically has to stay in the back line, when he used to play characters that were typically upfront or closer to the action.  
 
It sounds like you are aware of this to some degree, but you would be surprised how artifacts of former playstyles carry on to different roles.  
 
One of the things that I've found helpful is completely playing for other teammates rather than myself.  I know this sounds kinda "duh," but what I mean is I will consciously focus on becoming someone's body guard instead of going out and proactively killing someone on my own.  I let the enemy come to me rather than me going to it.  Sounds like this could be helpful in your case.  I imagine your friend overextends, so chances are the enemy will go to him.  If you clean up/protect as a DPS, that will open other opportunities for your team.   
seems like he's playing like he's having an ana always having his back, he just needs to adopt to your teams healers not having him as much in a focus as you probably did
Ask him to practice zarya. Honestly if you have someone you can play with and have been playing it is definitely better than attempting solo q. Believe me, if I had a duo partner like that who played  with me I would be pretty happy as it would reduce the chances of getting a torb on eichenwalde attack.
Those are variables you cannot influence whereas your friend, you can teach or givevtios to improve.

Ask him to practice zarya she is scary in this junk rat meta. And you can have combos with her which guarantees team wipes. 
In season 5 I fought my way from 1500 to 2500 in SoloQ [The last 200 with a 2 other very friendly people :-)].
After palycement matches I placed there and this season I experience way more toxicity less willingly Tank and support players. I try to fill in but I often need to play Heroes I´not on such a high skill Level. Since s6 began i dropped 450 SR and probably fall into Silver again.
I can´t speak for the majority but I think S6 is atleast different in some way.

> Since then we rarely played other games, only overwatch for hundreds of hours.

Take a break. You both might be burning out without realizing it or getting some fatigue. I had this problem myself and after a break went from mid diamond to mid masters in a short amount of time. If you're worried about your aim being ruined by another shooter, play a top-down RPG, Rocket League, something else that isn't first-person. You don't have to stop playing for a month, but a day or two will do wonders.
I would play quickplay with him for a while and maybe discuss changing roles.  If he isn't mechanically skilled enough and his game sense isn't there yet maybe you can help improve it.  This works better if you have more people in a stack and can have them fill support so he could try tank or something.

I usually queued comp support/tank/flex or support/tank/dps.  

What is your friend's hero pool like?  What is your hero pool like? You should play your best heroes in comp.  Something that will win team fights and have synergy.
You mean that out of 5 games, you win 4 playing alone? If that's the case and you can maintain an impressive 80% winrate play alone for a few games and don't worry about losing any rank, as you can regain it extremely easily. Or maybe you just got lucky for a few games and that's all.

I usually play with friends that are around 2400 sr. While playing with them I lose a lot more sr than I win, so it drags my rank down and I hover around 2750+-50. Seasons 2,3 and 4 none of them played so I played exclusively soloQ, and I always got to around 3.2k sr. But you know what? I don't give a fuck that I'm 500 sr below my "true" rank, whatever that means, because I like playing with them.

SR is just a made up number stored in some server fuck knows where, while your duo buddy is a person, and most importantly, your friend. Are you really so worried that he is "holding your sr from being *slightly* above average"? Enjoy the game dude. There is nothing wrong with you wanting your friend to improve, but don't overdo it.
He has learned bad habits through bad practice, if he wants to improve and he can take being criticized you should be honest and tell him what you think and what he should improve. If he can't take being criticzed then play something where you can work together to the point where he can follow you while you are calling the shots and then he can learn what is a good strategy that way instead. Recording gameplay and looking over it is also a pretty good way of learning  and seeing mistakes you make because you are not in the heat of battle.
That's happened to me. I just jump right into solo when I hop on after warming up. If I get a private message I just tell em' I don't have much time only for this game, or "not much time gotta bail soon" 

They usually don't catch on after that. 

I hit masters last season while my friend sunk down to 2400  
17 games isn't anything statiscally speaking. Try a 1000
Ask him if he's open to advice and give me his in-game name.
Try to gain SR, sure. But if he's dropping, stay with him.

If my mate started dropping, I would throw games to stay with him.
Seriously. There is such thing as a slump, too. I'd advise taking a small break from the game. Taking a week off after playing pretty consistently each day helped me break out of a slump where everything seemed to be going wrong and in reality I was just overthinking the game. It's easy to get into competitive and stop having fun because winning feels so important, but sometimes having fun and not stressing over the game will allow you to think more clearly and play better. Taking a small break can help you come back with a fresh perspective. 
We played much ana/soldier back when DVA wasn't in every game. Any other synergies apart from pharah mercy?
Make vods and watch it together. Find your way to deal with "new meta". Or take a small break - it works for us. When it doesn't go right we spend weekend in sc2 and come back refreshed.
Dva Winston is fantastic in duo queue, but also consider others. You're taking two tank roles and you might get a few tank mains. 
Pharmercy all up in that bitch ez
Agreed. Have had god-like runs and sickening losing streaks reguardless of teammates. It evens out in the long run but 12/5 game sample sizes are far too small
Exactly this, you need to make a choice, either you play with him because hey it's your dude after all, he matters more than some virtual ranking against people you will never meet. Or you are committed to climb the ladder then get a second account where you will enjoy your solo climb.

Don't lose a friend for virtual points. 
Yeah, but for fun they'd be on qp, they're on comp to win
Was it worth it?
????????????? Uhh
Anything that can hold a high ground and offer Mercy a quick escape from the battle really. Tracer and Sombra are both quite poor to combo with Mercy since they'll never offer her a safe place and your friend is likely to find you to be the best dd on the team, making poor decisions trying to keep you alive.

So pharah, mccree, widow, hanzo, all the tanks really, soldier. Especially if the rest of the team pick melee heavy. Playing a mercy with a team that is all up front is very challenging, so help him ease in to it :) 
If tracer is your strongest pick then you should ask your friend about learning zarya. The pulse bomb combo is nothing to scoff at and now that mobile heroes can't get out of grav it's much easier to get team wipes with it. You should also find his strongest pick and get experience with a hero that synergizes well with that. 
1 tank 1 support: Rein, Ana. Winston, Zen. Hog, Zen. Hog, Mercy. 

1 Tank 1 Dps: Zarya, Tracer. Zarya, Genji. Zarya, Doomfist. Zarya, Junkrat. Hog, Reaper. Hog, Junkrat. Winston, Tracer. Winston, Genji. Rein, McCree. Rein, Bastion. Orisa, Bastion. Orisa, Torbjorn. Orisa, Junkrat.

1 dps 1 support: Mercy, Pharrah. Lucio, Reaper. Zen, Genji. Zen, Tracer. Ana, Soldier. Ana, Genji. Ana, Bastion.

There are more decent combinations than this but this is a start.


If you or your friend can learn Winston/Zen that's a pretty solid duo queue synergy. I have lots of luck with that. Granted I'm a tank main 
Winston and Tracer have incredible synergy if he can play tank. The ability to dive the same healer together and burst them down is invaluable. 
* Doomfist/Zarya
* Genji/Zen
* Genji/Zarya
* Torb/Orisa
* Widow/Mercy
* Reaper/Lucio
* Winston/Ana
* Rein/Bastion
* Bastion/Ana
* Bastion/Mercy
* Any DPS/Zen
* Any ranged DPS/Rein
* Flanker/Dva or Winston
* McCree/Mercy or Zen
* Hog/Any support
* Lucio/Any support
Me and my friend always go Zarya and Rein, combining your ults is a lot better than Most would expect
Genji/tracer dva/Winston 
I had a ton of success with my buddy as Winston and me as zen. Harmony on Winston and discord on who he dives. I don't like calling discords or forget as I'm too focused on my play. So I would have him tell me who he was jumping on and just discord that target. 

Gave us initiation, defensive ult, zoning ult, shields, dps, 

As long as we had one other support, rest of comp didn't really matter. But most teams after seeing Winston Zenyatta would generally pick dva/Zarya and hitscan of some kind. 

Went like 15-3 over the course of 3 sessions before season 5 ended. 
I definitely agree with the "synergy strategy."  Finding synergies is defining your role relative to another specific player(s).  So as Mercy, I would ask myself, "What am I going to do with my teammates?"

For main tanks without self-heal (Rein, Winston, Orisa), I would spend a lot of time healing them so they could play a bit more aggressively than their inherent shielding would otherwise support.

For slow DPS that does not do a lot of flanking or kill-confirmation (Soldier, McCree, Junkrat, Zen), I would be damage-boosting them so they can turn damage into kills.

For snipers and builders, I would be using them as "anchor-points" to escape or move around the fight quickly.

Unfortunately, there isn't much synergy between Mercy and flank/kill-confirmation DPS like Tracer and Sombra, which may be part of the problem you're having.  They're just too high mobility, too low health, and too far out of position to be constantly useful to Mercy.  Instead, Zen or Lucio would be better supports to synergize with these kinds of DPS.
Winston+Genji or Tracer since you mentioned you like Tracer.

Mercy pairs very well with McCree, Widow, Pharah (obviously) and S76.

Lucio is a good choice in many team comps but it's usually more on the Lucio to play with his team, not the other way around. If he's being too aggressive on Lucio playing Dva or Winston and treating him like a diving Genji or Tracer also works somewhat well, just go in and support him. Sometimes helping a teammate with a play that should be dumb will work out if it's not just them alone.

As for his problems with DPS, the best way to get DPS to perform better is to give them all kinds of space. In other words, have a great tank. A good Reinhardt for example makes Soldier, McCree, and Reaper's jobs infinitely easier. Having the better Reinhardt is almost an insta-win if everything else is pretty close. A great Winston is annoying, he's distracting, he breaks the enemy up and makes them turn around.

Kinda just throwing out all kinds of suggestions here since I'm not too sure on your friends hero pool
Rein + Zarys, Rein + Ana, Tracer + Zen, Genji + Zen, Winston + Zen, Reaper + Zarya, Tracer + Zarya, Reaper + Zarya, Lucio + Reaper.  Those are all the different combos my duo partner and I run.
And then a zenyatta orbs you and you die. You need protection.
If his friend is as serious about climbing as he is, then there is no need to lie. I tell my group straight up when I don't want to play with them. There's time for fun, but then there's time for serious gaming. If anything, his friend is in the way of him enjoying the game to the fullest.
Gr8 post
Ok, then gaining SR is largely pointless compared to gaining slightly less SR while having fun with friends.

Point is, recreation is more meaningful if you have someone to share it with.

(Also, I have fun on comp, I hope you do too!)
> Yeah, but for fun they'd be on qp

There is nothing fun about qp. It is a cesspool.
In my case it was because he was pretty toxic. TONS of fun at first, but if we started losing it got REALLY bad. 


Can confirm. Winston main who was a former mercy main, I've made half a dozen friends with other mercies just by flying them to safety and providing angel target when they respawn  
Also make sure he is not focusing on just you. A lot of times when I match up with a pair and one is mercy, the mercy never seems to be healing the rest of the team, only the friend. 
If his friend plays Lucio and Mercy no way is he going to be a good Zarya. They should just try Reaper/Lucio, it's a secret god-tier combo for a lot of maps that nobody talks about.  
Also sombra and hog,my friend and I do this and we destroy, sombra distracts them hog hooks them in and finishes them off
Zarya + Rein is a great duo because you can both benefit from each other, support each others aggressive plays thus creating space and farming ults faster.

But never combo shatter + grav, NEVER... Both ults are teamfight winning by themselves as long as tgere is follow up. Sure with no follow up they won't work but another ult that also requires follow up is not a good follow up.
I agree with Rein and Zarya as well. My buddy and I went 6-0 last time we played together. We didn't always do rein and zarya but everytime we were losing we switched to them and just dominated. 

One match it was 3-3 in overtime. Enemy team had 4min and we had 1. We only pushed the cart like 30meters in our 1min overtime then held them for the entire 4min at the first choke. Relentless gravs and earthshatters. They just couldn't get it together lol
> If anything, his friend is in the way of him enjoying the game to the fullest. ^1 ^2 ^3

^1 According to OP. 
^2 Based on a 12 game sample size. 
^3 With no data or video to back it up. 
Clearly his friend and op have a different approach to the game. Though this does not mean the game is not enjoyed at its fullest since it is game the main goal is to enjoy it. There is not one good way to do so.
I believe he has to decide for himself what to do because climbing the ladder by being hardcore may not be compatible with enjoying sweet comp games with friends.
When I play with lower ranks friends I just don't watch my SR because I am confident I will climb anyway. Therefore I don't need an alt account but OP may feel it is too hard to climb and lose with his friend. To enjoy the two aspects of the game, he probably has to get 2 games.
Just my 2 cents
I made my point really bad, of course you should have fun playing comp I just meant it's not really a messing around mode and no one's having fun when your friend isn't doing great and it's awkward to mention that the team is doing worse because of them
Fair point, reaper/Lucio combo has wrecked my team more than I'd like to admit (Pharah player here). However, playing mercy helps with the instinct to protect the team, and zarya does that in a similar way, just not healing. Personally zarya is a hero that I think everyone needs to learn in this game, she's just too good and combos great with tons of heroes.
what's so great about Reaper and Lucy? is the playstyle about speeding Reaper in and out? booping people into him? or just stacking the passive heals?
Yeah it sucks when me and my buddy literally go," fucking wail them" at the same time and press q literally at the same time without thinking haha. We both see the same opening and think NOW. (im talking withing 0.01 of a secomd)
Well, if you get a grav with a lot of people, you can shatter them all, then firestrike the entire team for a ton of damage, and just swing with your hammer, in case you want to save any DPS ults for later
I'm just saying that she's high skill, requires pretty strict tracking and a good amount of practice getting a feel for her rightclick drop to reliably land them at midrange, and the gamesense required is at the very least at the level of Mercy, possibly higher. If he were just to start playing Zarya in comp instead of a support I imagine the SR would drop even lower because a bad Zarya can feed pretty hard and will likely struggle to get even two gravs in the average round if their aim is poor.  
All of the above, but mostly speed boost. It's killer on koth maps. 
Without concerted efforts by the enemy team to lock down Reaper and Lucio getting him in the fray quickly he can easily run away with games.
Yeah I've had that happen aswell. You should decide who is going to ult before a fight, it prevents ult stacking.
Yeah but shatter doesn't do much damage, instead you could not waste a teamfight winning ult and get in an another hammer swing dealing a bungh of dmg
Well yeah, but that comes with playing a new hero in general. I'm willing to bet a McCree one trick would drop if he tried to pickup soldier without any practice. I'm not saying pick Zarya straight away in comp, I'm saying get practice with the hero before you head into comp. 
Way overthinking. This is 2700 ELO - you don't need god mechanics to learn a new character
Yes! It's not intuitive for everyone, but having the conversation BEFORE the fight starts "I'm going to ult first this next fight" goes a long way. I've found that the player who's more trigger happy with their ult is better served being the first, otherwise they may get impatient and jump the order if they become anxious.
Yeah every time it happens I kick myself and he does too, just get wrapped up in the moment, see that one perfect opening but yeah we need to get into the habit of deciding who should ult first
Definitely this. Having a plan when the fight starts is an enormous help, especially with Zarya.
It's rarely teamfight winning tho, at least not in my high-plat/low-diamond tier.
Soldier and McCree are both aim-based classes, there's a lot more carryover between them. The difference between Mercy and Zarya is like telling a Rein main to "flex" to Widow. It's an entirely different skillset, it's like the difference between changing your accent and learning a whole new language.
Don't underestimate plat dude, it's chock full of competent onetricks.
Then it sounds like you are lacking the follow up damage. I'm in the same tier and it is really important to make sure your team knows you are going to shatter and are ready to follow up.

Also make sure to call out wich shattered targets to focus and make sure your teammates are not getting distracted by other things.

Being vocal usually helps a lot, and even if your shatters aren't teamfight winning, shattering a grav is still a waste...
Fair point, though I feel Zarya and mercy have similar skill sets than rein and widow. However my point being that they shouldn't just jump into comp with no experience on the hero, and play them in quickplay/arcade first 
They're either missing basic positioning or basic aim. Competence starts in diamond and is standard in masters. 
Well... being in the same tier you should know that being vocal doesn't always help. I often call out, but in my opinion its more about yourself checking your teammates ults, seeing which people are in the fight and not, and making it as easy as possible for your teammates to follow up your ult without having to have a super thought out strategy, and instead just doing it
I see where you're coming from in terms of the general mindset of looking around, being aware of your team and flankers, etc. That would definitely be a jumpstart in terms of playing Zarya. However the issue is that there's still an execution barrier that Mercy doesn't train at all, Zarya is fairly demanding in terms of aim in both the hitscan and projectile disciplines.

It's for this reason that I definitely agree with your sentiment about how most players should have a pocket Zarya. The twist on it for me though is that my main reason for this is that she can help projectile players train hitscan tracking and hitscan players train projectile prediction/aim compensation. It's a bigger entry barrier for a support-focused player.

But yeah, quickplay training is a must. The thing is though that because of the lack of skill overlap it would take a lot more acclimation to fully pick up, plus from the given info this guy seems like a casual so I just don't know if it's feasible to assume he'll put in the required time to actually get good if he's already struggling to get out of plat as Mercy, widely renowned as one of the most carryable heroes.
Yeah, some fights are lost and some teams don't wotk even if you call them out, but calling your ult and when you are going to use it is still better than not calling the ult out.

And even if every shatted doesn't result into a won fight it still doesn't justify wasting it into a grav.

What do to about friends getting boosted?
I've recently had a friend take the path of having their account boosted into higher ranks then they play at normally. I know this is a semi-regular thing with in the community but there's a couple of things I'm having issues with the whole situation

1. The boosting has been done by a fmr top 500 player who was in top 50 for several seasons

2. One of these people have been only had the interest in getting a golden weapon for their main hero of play.

3. They have no intent on trying to play at these ranks but have only done this for the weapon.

The major debate I've had inside and with our other friends about this is in-regards to players they faced against. These placements were done on a silver account (that was then placed to plat, played into dia)

These people playing against basically had a loss tied up in the first place. All for this ones persons golden weapon. It's really irking our friend group and we don't know what to say to our friends about this. They think we're attacking her but we want to tell her what we see as a harmful thing for other players.

Cheers It is shitty, but its weird that you care so much about this to make it an issue between you and your friend(s). Let it go.
1. Respectfully explain exactly why getting her account boosted damages overwatch.

2. Tell her it's alright that she did it this one time. Odds are she had no intent of causing trouble for so many people. The goal is to avoid making her feel guilty and get defensive. Note: If she did intend to cause all that harm, then why are you friends?

3. Then politely ask that she doesn't do it again.

4. As for the rest of the friend group, just let them know that she made a mistake, she is human after all. Then just let her video game numbers slowly decline. 
It's super shitty, and also against Blizzard's rules I think, but those people who lost to that booster probably forgot about it by the time they queued into their next game or when they went to bed that day - still sucks for them though, especially those who had bad matches before it

If the user paid to be boosted, I think that's a huge waste because if they want to play Comp legitimately, they're just gonna immediately drop. (Don't tell me a Silver Mercy or Lucio can hold their own at Diamond or Master because they can't)

I also think golden weapons don't really have that much value any more - even in QP, you can regularly see 2-4 each match. Many players have, like, 5 of them at this point 
In wow there was a case where a pro wasn't allowed to play on a tournament because he boosted some1. I hope blizzard does the same with overwatch. If he is a famous top 50 player he probably plays for a team. So yeah, the problem could easily be solved by blizzard. 
There's nothing you can do about it. It's already happened.

Just let her gradually drop down in rank over time.
I mean it's a stupid thing to fall out over but I don't think op is saying they are no longer friends because of it, I think he's asking advice as to how to encourage the players not to get boosted without coming off as a tosser.

Anyone ever feel like they don't "deserve" the rank they are in because of the heroes they play?
I am a flex player in Masters. Like I literally play every role, but the very most playtime are on tanks, because they rarely get instalocked and playing tank also carried me to Master.

Now don't get me wrong, I think that I am a really good tank (for a Master at least), but sometimes I feel like I should be able to be "really good" in more, like having good aim and great mechanical skill, to deserve being a true "Master".

I would actually love to main Sombra, but I had horrible placements (trolls and such), so I have horrible win rates this season so far on dps heroes and now I am afraid to instapick them.

Idk maybe I am just silly, but I guess I'd love to be able to hold my own in Masters playing dps and Ana to feel like I am truly a Master.This post is a little confusing to me but I'll try my best. I'm a grandmaster tank/ support main.  I used to feel this way when I was in master, but I found that was because overwatch's roles each have different skillsets that don't necessarily transfer (i.e. aiming is most important for dps, while positioning, teamwork, foresight more important for tanks, etc). So, that means you may be a master level tank and that's what let you climb up to master, but you might not be a master level dps (no offense to your skill, it may just be because you don't get to play it as often). Flex players don't always play every role to the same skill level, and that's a very natural thing. 

Mains are a label that people put on themselves. So based on what you wrote, my advice for you to improve further would be to not be so focused on the label of being a flex player and try to improve on what you're already good at (maybe tanking?). Hint: working on better ult usage and economy, and always thinking about positioning is what let me climb to grandmaster, at least personally

Once I hit grandmaster, I started learning how to play other roles well on an alt account (currently learning dps on a diamond alt account). I decided to do this because I had a similar thought process to you about deserving your rank: playing with friends, I couldn't hard carry as dps even though I was "such high rank". 

Feeling like you deserve your rank is something that comes with time. Last season, I climbed into master and dropped back out over 20 times , but each time I climbed back up, I became a better player. So just play more games, try to improve, and don't forget to have fun! Hope this helped.
I can relate to this. Originally when I was having this issue I was searching very hard for tips, and for someone to give me something, but I had to figure it out myself. You just have to keep playing. I started out expanding the supports I play and then I moved to tank and dps (as a former mercy otp). I only play the characters I am comfortable with and I really understand. I knew I could make an impact as pharah and dva, and I do. You need to train your sombra and learn what to do and you need to get out of the tank mindset and into the sombra mindset. It just takes time. If you fail miserably at the beginning, that's perfectly fine. You will get better fast. Also, play with friends it's so helpful to have support and synergy. 
i went through this a few seasons ago and bought an alt to practice the heroes i wasnt comfortable on. it worked, would recommend.

edit: if you're poor then just play whatever you want to practice on your main. you'll derank originally but after a month or two you'll probably be back to the rank you were at, except as a more rounded player
Aiming is not the only skill in this game. Gamesense is a skill. Positioning is a skill. Callouts are a skill. Ability management is a skill. 

There seems to be an undercurrent of this idea that only mechanical skill is true skill. This is absolutely not true. That's not even true in CS:GO. You are masters because you are skilled at the game. Are you skilled at aiming? Maybe not, I've never met you to know.

What to keep in mind is that if you don't have practice with DPS at a masters level, you're obviously not going to be a masters level DPS. Likewise, if a masters level DPS doesn't have practice tanking, he's not going to be a masters level tank. Each role has different skills that need to be fine tuned and honed. Some have more overlap than others, obviously, but the only way to be good at something is to practice it.

FYI, Sombra is a very hard character to play, and it's not because she's mechanically difficult. The gamesense and ability management required to play her well is extremely high, and it's fairly unique to her playstyle. So if you want to play Sombra, practice her a lot. :)
I feel like I can climb but i deserve my rank cuz I'd rather play who I want 
I'm a GM Lucio main, and sometimes I feel as though I don't deserve my rank because of playing the "healbot", but I can flex to all other supps/tanks and a couple dps too and play comfortably at my ELO. Generally if you climb to a rank playing 1 or 2 heroes, even if it's one that doesn't require aim (like Lucio) the positioning and gamesense will be on par and as long as you know your job, you will most likely perform fine :)
I play Ana and feel like im doing well but cant get out of Plat since Season 4. 😢
Do you feel you play to win or play characters you have fun with?
There's more to this game than aim and mechanical skill. I'm a tank main and I 100% believe I deserve my rank. Good tank play is so under appreciated in this game (support play too, but to a lesser extent in this tank main's opinion) and there is a huge difference between a gold Reinhardt and a diamond Reinhardt, masters Reinhart, and GM Reinhardt.
Personally, I got (in my humble opinion) really good with Sombra, and that was largely what got me into/kept me in Masters, climbing all the way from mid-plat (I'd used Pharah mostly to climb to there from the literal bottom of gold). I'm also a pretty good Mercy (no laughter, please) and a pretty capable Zarya or Orisa. I always tried to pick Sombra when it was a valid pick, but pretty frequently I'd have to change to stop a team from tilting or to go support because my teams would inexplicably decide to go with Solo Healer Sombra - I've unsubscribed from YourOverwatch over the amount of grief the "Sombra's a SUPPORT!?!?" video has caused me in the hero select screen - and I'd play a lot of Mercy. I always felt like I wasn't really having to work as hard as I would in another role and that I didn't deserve to stay in Masters when I got stuck with her for a few games in a row, and while I don't mind playing Ana or Zen I can't reliably contribute as much with them so I stick with my strongest healer. I'm not one of *those* Mercys who lets their whole team die just for the five man rez, I'm always tempo rezzing and flying around to try to hit everyone with heals, but it definitely does feel like I haven't earned my place when I'm playing as her. 

Meanwhile, when I'm playing as Sombra, I know I've earned it because I've managed to climb despite all the people who've thrown based on my pick for the last few seasons and that she's a challenging hero to be reliably effective with, and I'm good at working with my team to use her properly. OP, if you'd like any tips on Sombra I'd be happy to help you out, send me a message if you'd like :)
i don't play junkrat or mercy
I'm not as high as you but I'd say one should be able to play all heroes at a max of two levels below their sr. Not as an end all be all rule but as a general guideline for how good most players are. 

You're in masters, I'm guessing you could totally play all heroes at a plat level. Am I right? That's pretty badass. You can play EVERY hero at a better than average level compared to the community, then tank?!?! You're a monster at tanks! Oh i'm sorry, *master at tanks ;)
First off, unless someone boosted you, you deserve your rank, period. I repeat, you deserve your rank.

But, I think I can explain part of the reason you are feeling this, and even why it is a partially legitimate feeling.

Every patch release brings changes in what heroes and play style are effective. These changes can be quite drastic when a hero gets a radical rework, a major buff, or a powerful new character is released.

Some of your anxiety may be related to the idea that your current heroes and play style may become less effective or drop out of the meta altogether. DVa is going to become more aim dependent, Mercy's play style will change radically, etc. What if the the most effective comps start to depended on a solo healing Ana again, will your available hero pool drop considerably?

Most of the heroes are dependent on aim to be effective. Some aim dependent heroes will always be in meta. At some level you know that the easiest way to stay in masters is to have master level aim.

As others have said, the easiest way to correct this is to think of it as a skill you are consciously working on, worry less about rank and more about improving. The first step is probably figuring out what kind of equipment or environment changes you could use, and what a good practice routine would be. But you can also do things like play FFA death match, 3v3 lockout, mystery heroes to work on carrying practiced skills into "real life" without just taking them straight into a comp game.
I went 3/7 in placements and got placed 3600sr

I didnt play ranked last season. But im just an assault/ tank
As long as it's not mercy you probably deserve your rank 
Thank you very much, that was pretty good advice. I thought about buying another account for dps practice only a couple times, but right now I am just a poor University student and 40€ are like a week of food haha

I really stress myself at getting better at everything, and get frustrated at myself a lot when I make dumb decisions. That being said, Overwatch is my very first competitive game and I actually bought my first gaming PC last December. I have never played  PC ever in my life before that (except Age of Empires on my Mom's PC 10 years ago) and maybe it is too late now to become a high tier dps player, but who knows, I guess I just have to play. 
i think positioning is still most important for dps, you can hit 100% of your shots, but when you're out of position getting into 5v1 all the time that doesn't help you anything
Happy that you made the decision to expand your hero pool, that's always something that will make you generally better in comp and I hope you succeed playing other heroes just as much.

I would like to play with my friends, but they don't play it anymore. They just got too tilted and stuck at their rank, I am the only one of them (unfortunately) that reached Masters a while back in solo q. 

But well I guess I just have to play then and hope I don't drop out of Master.
I think I'm gonna do that, thanks!
I think I am just going to pick other heroes, regardless if I drop out of Master for a bit (though I don't think this is necessarily going to happen). I know I can make an impact with other heroes aswell, but I rarely give myself the chance to prove it. Definitely got some new motivation going into comp later, thank you.
Good to have some insight from way higher skilled players than me, thanks!
A little bit of both.
Dude, you really don't have to defend yourself for playing Mercy, just saying.

Anyway, I'm at work right now, but when I get home I'll be sure to shoot you a message! :)
You're definitely right. I wasn't being very specific there, but of course positioning is important no matter who you're playing. Thanks for pointing that out
You can also make more friends, I make new ones just by clicking the button at the end or if they said something funny and were good I add them. And believe in yourself dude, I bet you can hold at least diamond with your gamesens and dropping out of masters seems like it would suck but it doesn't. The fact that I'm in diamond still was amazing to me because I expected to drop to gold. 
Anytime!
I've found I usually make friends when I'm queuing with others anyway. It definitely takes the edge off the new person trying to group with us if there are multiple people to interact with. We can usually get a few to jump on board if we roll, but it's worth noting the next game probably won't go as hot.

I'd recommend just playing positive with at least a duo. Join team voice and have fun. I've played with a few dozen and there are five that I might play with regularly if they're on.

Playing with the new people in a group is good too, because I've seen people get tilted off of nonsense and we had to drop the group and regroup to get rid of them. Adding and being added can go bad, but if you're positive it should largely go well.
That was really nice, thank you. :)

What To Do as a Winston Main Against Hog + Reaper?
So I started playing early season 5 and have pretty much played Winston all the time, every game. I climbed from 1500 SR to 3000 SR and didn't have to worry about (or learn any other characters). Eventually, the reaper buff came and there was a good counter to Winston. Now even when the enemy team had a Reaper I could still be effective (not as much obviously) just by always keeping track of where he was. Now along comes this Roadhog buff and people start using him too. Well today, I dropped 100 SR in a span of 5 games and 3 of my 4 losses were because the other team had both hog and reaper (other was a throw rip). This was the first time my teammates have actually blamed my character pick and told me to switch since I started playing Winston. And actually I felt like I probably needed to as well. Is there any way you guys have been getting around Hog and Reaper with Winston? Or is it just a situation that you need to switch off in?If enemy team has both of them i would probably swap. As a general rule of thumb if enemy team has 2+ counters and you feel effectively countered, then you swap. I generally swap to zarya/dva against a reaper/hog to peel more for teammates 
Dude, I've found it hard to play tank PERIOD into the new Reaper/Rein/Junkrat meta. No tank (besides Orisa, who was barely in the game when this happened) has received a substantive buff since Roadhog was initially nerfed. 

Since then, Roadhog, Reaper, and Junkrat have seen SUBSTANTIAL buffs, all the while leaving all other tanks the exact same. Quite frankly, I'm overwhelmed right now on all tanks. I don't know what you do because you have fewer shields/barriers, so you're taking more damage, and they've got more ult charge. I feel like I'm just a battery charging the enemy DPS ults, which gets my healers killed, which loses games.

If I had sole control of the meta right now, I'd think you probably want to avoid any tank not named Roadhog. But you'll get flamed for not going 2-2-2, even if you think it gives you a better chance to win. 
Reaper and hog both counter Winston, so if you cannot do anything about it, swap. But otherwise, watch were they are and make sure you aren't close enough that the can kill you before you leap away.
Nothing. Just die
1 counter to your hero is okay I think 2 is a pretty big deal. Because monkey isn't good against armor which the main tank probably has, so he's only going to be good against half their team. Unless you're playing with a Dva and you're playing defensively but at that point you're still probably better off as Rein. 

Rein+Zarya/Dva are pretty good against them. Or a hog of your own in the off tank slot especially if they don't have a Rein. 
take it boi
That's one of the reasons why you want to have a diverse hero pool if you want to climb higher. OW is a game where you have to adapt to a specific situation, so sometimes you just have to switch heroes. Don't blame the meta or get discouraged...see it as a reason to improve. :)  
You will want to switch, you will get shredded to pieces sadly. Otherwise you will try to stay away from them, but evading them will most likely cause you to be less effective and you will not create much space
Well if you are not gonna switch then i reccomend being on higher ground and poke them if they're focus putting pressure in the front line Like the corner at the start at route 66 just make sure your dont poke your head to far because the hog can just drag you down. If you're going to engage dont use your jetpack when coming done since you are at high ground.bubble dance when you fight both of them,bait roadhog hook with your shield and go in and out with your shield when going against reaper/roadhog but when the shield cracks jump out. This usually agros the reaper which causes him overextend but when he does you can go for the supports which he has to go back and protect,this is a oppurntunity for the team to jump in and take him out. This works great with d.va dm so just make the d.va DM's you when you are taking damage. I dont know if this helps, i use this alot and i dont have problems with reaper/hogs. Just tell me if this works
Yeah i've been trying this a little bit. I really need to work on saving jump pack though
Yea man i used have that mentallity that jumping straight into the supports would get me kill but hog/reap really made me play differently even better.

Dva ejection prediction?
When you kill dva mech does baby dva have a predetermined ejection path? Or are there different arcs and directions she can control? And if so which directions? She initially jumps from the top of the mech and she can control her direction and how high she jumps (by holding jump).

If you are playing a hero that has explosive damage, such as Pharah, Junkrat, Soldier or Zarya, you can grenade/rocket the top of the mech, just as she is exiting it, to get a guaranteed hit on her. This will make her below half HP in most cases.
It's a controlled path, more or less. One of the reasons you should fire helix rocket or Zarya alt fire as she ejects is to get the free damage and usually knock her further into the air since it's easier to track falling targets. Careful though, you can sometimes knock her onto a second story floor for a Jack Sparrow escape if she's really lucky.
If you’re playing a hero with splash, shoot the back area of the mech (where she gets out) just as she ejects, you’ll always hit the splash.
Always exits from the same point, but can control the direction and if you hold space you will be ejected higher.

Also a neat trick that I haven't seen posted on this thread; as rein, mini dva can be consistently killed before she ejects. If you attack the mech after it's killed, mini dva inside will still take damage (75 per hit), and a second swing as she ejects will deal the 150 to kill her. If you time it right, she can't escape no matter what she does, though some times killing her right away is not the best choice.
she can jump out of the mech and choose her path where she wants to go (forwards, backwards, left, right, etc.)
> and how high she jumps (by holding jump).

Well! Til. Thanks!
ive always had success with lateralish rear ejections like a 150 degree arc.
Not sure if the method has changed, but I haven't been able to do this for awhile now. Can't remember exactly which patch it was after which it stopped working for me, but you used to be able to *flyy* by holding jump as you ejected. Now it's pretty tame.
>lateralish rear ejections

Best band name ever


I had to google that word just to make sure whether it was a word or not...

I'm not sure how I feel rn
Might be in the timing.  My last game played today I saw a baby dva totally launch out of suit, it took me by surprise how high she got because it seems lately baby dva hasn't been launching like she used too.
Hmm I'll try it different ways when I can. I used to just hold space from the moment my mech died till I eject, and it would just launch me.
Hm. I wonder if this is consistent with the basketballs being fucked. Each time they got fucky, folks were reporting strange shit with hero trajectory.

People who managed to improve their aim, what did you do that helped?
For anyone that started out with not so great aim but managed to improve it to a good level, what did you do that helped?

Post any drills/practice habits/anything else that was beneficial.I've made some changes recently to my setup and I've noticed a marked improvement in my aim.

* Locked my DPI to 700, no changing.
* Bought a high precision mouse.
* Got a much bigger mouse pad.
* Upgraded to a 144hz monitor w/ gsync
* Practiced my shot timing. I'll take more time to line up shots instead of spamming. 
* Dumped my graphics settings to mainly low / medium in order to keep my FPS around the cap (300)
In terms of practice habits, you want to follow a loop that looks like this:

1. Identify a deficiency
2. Find a way to practice to improve that deficiency
3. Do that practice
4. go back to 1

For example, I found that I relied on strafe aiming too much. So to fix that I would go into the practice range, where the moving bots are, and I would just take my left hand off the keyboard while shooting. This way, the only possible way I could hit my shots would be to use my right arm, which is exactly what I wanted to practice doing.
I play aim hero but idk if I do it the way most people do. I only use the reflex mode and I do custom difficulty where I have the target stay out for 1 second, then I focus on smoothly moving my cursor over to the target before I hit it. I think this helps with my tracking so I'm less shaky in game.

But what really helped me improve is playing comp (not quick play, this is important) and focusing exclusively on aiming well and not trying to win. I noticed my aim was improving when I played qp with no pressure on myself, but as soon as I moved to comp I cared really hard about winning and couldn't think about stuff I needed to work on. So I did my best to drop that mindset and stopped caring if I won or lost. I muted voice comms and just tunnel vision super hard on placing my crosshair over the target before I clicked and tried to smoothly track. I dropped a ton of SR but my aim got way better. I think for a lot of people their inability to accept losing SR keeps them from improving. 
(context warning: console scrub)

I switched linear ramp on, now that it's been fixed.
Mystery heroes, forcing me to try to be effective with McCree since mid-S4.
[deleted]
OW for PS4 is the first FPS I've ever tried to be good at, especially online. My aim when I started OW beta was insanely bad. I got better over time but two things made a HUGE difference that practice couldn't.

1) Kontrol Freaks stick grips. These work so so well. I personally have the Vortex but any would do. 

2) When aim ease in was added in the last patch everything changed. I found a post talking about how they found settings that are like other FPS games and tried it. Almost everything about my gameplay improved drastically. I always wanted to at least mess around with Genji, never could until now. I have the sens all the way to 100 and it's amazing. If you want the settings let me know but I've gone from mediocre aim to very accurate within a few matches, to try things out. 
Would average 25% on sombra and tracer back in January, and now hitting 40-50% with them, and 70-80% with Ana depending on team comp! 

A bunch of things contributed to that improvement, among them getting a better mouse, mousepad, 144hz monitor, and just playing the game a lot. 

I think the two main things were picking up aim hero and drilling that reflex and lighting gun mode, and actually turning UP my sensitivity. It's at 800dpi/5 in game sens now, more than double what I used to play with. My actions always felt sluggish and I couldn't turn fast enough at all, and everything felt so *slow*. Amping that sens. made my tracking/flicking much snappier, and somehow much smoother too.
I practiced. A lot. Like it took me 60-70 hours on Ana to not be bad at aiming. This might be a little Ana specific.

* Practice is not the same as playing. I have a goal I pick to work on every play session, and try to consciously correct myself when I make mistakes. Auto pilot is your worst enemy. It's how you'll fall back into bad habits. You need to be constantly thinking about what you're trying to practice.
* When learning to hip fire, I spent probably 10 hours of QP time chanting in my head "lead the shot", so I would remember to lead and not fall back into auto pilot bad habits.
* I practiced scoped shots even if it wasn't the best choice. I practiced flicking people at mid close range, then when I got more confident I started trying to hit the Genji across the map. At some point, I learned how to scope in and fire quickly for quick scoped shots.
* This might not affect a lot of people, but I realized I wasn't trying to make shots I was afraid I might miss. I was afraid of wasting ammo on a shot I might miss, and I wasn't even attempting the shots. I consciously decided to always fire at the target that needed the healing, even if it was a hard shot so I could practice those difficult shots.
* When I had a little bit of time to kill, but didn't want to start a game, I would climb to the roof of the practice range and jump onto the roof of the 2 story building (the one with the bots shooting at each other standing still). The angle is a bit weird, so it would let me practice weird angled shots which I am particularly bad at. I also practice shots on bots moving perpendicular to me by standing to the sides of the bots coming out of the doors.
So I haven't seen it mentioned here yet, but there is a lot that goes into seeing improvement in your aim. It's not as simple as hitting more shots or difficult shots. Improving your aim is not just a single mechanical skill, even if that's what most people focus on, it also includes target awareness, acquisition, and rapid adjustment.

I heavily play Widow, McCree, Soldier, Sombra, and Tracer -- all of these heroes require a degree of skill in both Tracking and Flicking. I gauge my improvement not by game stats (I don't check my accuracy stat in OW) but by clutch eliminations. Killing who I want, when I want, and when I need to. It's only obvious to you if you *could have* killed that Mercy if you didn't miss your last few shots. So essentially, for my rank, I went from not killing that Mercy/Lucio, to killing them consistently.

Here is what I did in order to improve my aim. Did this routine every day, and continue doing it, for at least 10-15 minutes.

* I practice my aim using the Training Room. I focus on doing headshots only and use Kephrii's routine of shooting 6 bots in the head as fast as possible. I go for accuracy versus time. After a while I notice my average time has improved.
* I train my flicks using the Training Room as well. If I can't get 5-6 killstreak with Widow, then my flick and scope charge timing are off. Use all the bots from all distances.
* I warm up my target acquisition by murdering those same training bots as McCree, but this time I shoot to kill and move on to the next bot. If I lose track of a bot before it dies (it moves behind cover) I need to hit another bot in it's place and go back to murdering my original target. Do not follow the bots, just stay in one general area and let them take cover.

Your goal isn't to do this until your fingertips bleed. Do 10-15 minutes in total to get yourself fully engaged in the game. It doesn't matter if you think the bots have a stupidly large hitbox or if they are predictable. That just means you have ZERO excuse to miss. But you will miss -- everyone will miss.

**Play Arcade/Quickplay (Deathmatch)**  
Deathmatch is the new king of aim training because of how screwy things can get. I am thinking about writing an article for how people can level up in FFA; I believe it is THAT helpful. You need to understand that it isn't about winning, but it is about hitting your shots. If you want to win, you need to practice your character play and gamesense not just your aim.  

Anyways, go into a game, load up McCree/Tracer, and get to work. Hit body shots, then move on to hitting body shots while aiming for the neck. Duel the enemy McCree at a distance. Duel a Hanzo. Duel Genji, Tracer, Pharah, Symmetra, all squishies. Be opportunistic: Take out anyone who is low health while they are dueling others. If you can't get that shot off right before they die and you lose the kill, your aim still needs improvement. 

Just by playing FFA you will be introducing yourself to incredible levels of complexity just not possible in Quickplay. You will think faster, shoot faster, and eventually get more accurate.
At the beginning of a match I'll pick a target (friendly teammate) and try to follow their movement with the crosshairs. After I get fluid with that, I'll try to predict their movement by moving the crosshairs in front of them as if I'm trying to lead them where to go. 

Or I'll throw up a spray and aim at specific targets in the spray. LIke Ana shrike skin head spray. I'll quickly shoot two darts where the eyes ought to be. They tend to glow and look cool. Unless your placement is off. 

That's just things I do to play around but kinda warm up. This is besides the standard bots/practice range. 
I played almost nothing but aim heroes for ~100 hours in QP/comp. Mostly warm up in dm now instead of QP. Drills bore me to tears and I find my aim is pretty consistent and strong without them anyway
osu

warmup before playing every day, usually by playing osu then going into practice range for a bit

simply playing the game
I turned down my sens very low and worked up to a better sens that's a bit higher.While it was low, i practice keeping me soon steady so it wasn't jittery. Then i did a bunch of tracking practice with and without shooting.i did it with smart targets (Ana) and fast ones (Lucio).
I changed my mouse sens. Found a Skyline video that showed how to optimize it. It was like night and day.
I used to have fairly bad aim, my hands are too shakey for precise shots and I'd get even shakier during high-pressure situations. What really helped is remembering to think things through, calm down, breath. A big thing I learned as Reaper when you are often in close range fights, don't fire wildly, set up each shot because one shot from you is probably worth a lot more than whatever they are shooting you with. This applies to just about any hero.

My aim is now decent enough I don't feel like dead-weight playing Ana or other hitscan. Don't ask me to focus a pharah though. 
Find another player, 1v1 McCree(or anyone you want to practice) only DM, Final Destination(Castillo or any simple map). I highly recommend to  turn off FtH(or any annoying and distracting abilities) and leaving the rest default. Maybe play with score and time limit.
Play Deathmatch with one hero for a few hours and try to only get headshots with them.  Did this with Zen and can outdual most people 1v1, hit a pick from across a map and hit his alt around a corrner more consistently now.  Started doing this with tracer and mccree and I'm getting headshots more consistently with them too.
Just played a lot. These days I find DM is a great place for practice, but I didn't do anything but comp before this mode appeared.
- found a good middle ground sensitivity/dpi combo and stuck with it to get used to it
- relentlessly assessed what was causing me to miss and try to do something different to correct it
- 2 similar situations: aimed differently in each but was more accurate in one of them *hypothesis* maybe in those types of situations it's better to aim with that style then? -> test/experiment -> observe -> analyze observations and results -> conclude -> conceptualize -> practice

- E.g., a lot of situations I found out when I tried to track smoothly/carefuly with mccree I missed more even when it seemed like it was a great situation to track smoothly/carefully and realized that when I got reticle a bit close then did a mini flick I landed more shots that way. So I started trying it more and it worked better and now that is my muscle memory. 
* Changed my sensitivity as follows

>> 1) started with sens at the distance needed so my full mousemat width was a 360. lets call that x [example: x = 10]

>> 2) set y = 0.5

>> 3) set LOW = x-yx, HIGH = x+yx [example: LOW = 10-0.5(10) = 5, HIGH = 10+0.5(10) = 15]

>> 4) practice drills at both LOW and HIGH sens, and decide which one naturally feels better - be sure to practice long enough that you warm up, and practice FINGER, WRIST and ARM movements. finger for small adjustments (strafe at long range), wrist for medium adjustments (strafe at medium range), arm for big adjustments (strafe at close range). if the sens is too high, you'll overaim with the fingers, if it's too low you'll struggle to move your arm enough to keep up with close range things moving past you. practice tracking moving bots, practice flick shots, practice 180 shots, chaining headshots (i use mcree for most of this) -- then switch to genji and practice generally jumping around and trying 3 shuriken + dash combos. try chain them, 3 shuriken headshot, dash to finish, repeat repeat repeat. on the group of moving bots in the training map this requires lots of quick turns and *not* faceplanting into walls, i feel this really lets you know your mobility limits for general panning. pick EITHER LOW or HIGH and decide which one felt *better* then set x = that sens [example, you thought 15 felt better, so x = 15 now]

>> 5) y = y - 0.1 [example y = 0.4]

>> 6) go back to step 3, and repeat until eventually the differences between the LOW and HIGH should be fairly negligible as they converge, pick the one you like, and if you can't decide use the average of the two.  the idea here is that you find the sensitivity that doesn't limit what you can do, allows the most use of all three parts of your arm you're going to be using (mitigating over and under-aiming as much as possible) -- and also ideally requiring the least amount of warm up time, because it's the most comfortable.

* warm up before play for about 10 mins with the drills above (4), the key parts there for me are tracking and flick shots with mccree, then mobility stuff with genji, really warm up all the muscles in my hand, and just get those headshots on point. try not overthink the shot, shoot fast, flick fast, if your reaction time is inherently bad you can cheese your accuracy by predicting where the bots will be (even though you're hitscan) -- really push yourself to reduce the amount of time it takes for your crosshair to be on target, not just knowing where they are going to be and waiting for them to move into it -- real players are not so predictable as the bots

* made a conscious effort to jump less when i'm trying to land shots and concentrate on my crosshair instead

* made a conscious effort to take high ground wherever possible, the angle you have to track someones head when they are moving at a different elevation requires not only horizontal tracking but vertical too, i realised at first i was bad on the high ground because my vertical tracking was not as consistent as my horizontal -- so i forced myself to do it, and i'm seeing an improvement there too

* for widow/ana changed relative scoped sensitivity such that traversing the screen requires the same amount of mouse movement when scoped and unscoped. For me this was a value of 50. I've seen reports for it being different for different people (perhaps a different ratio of mouse DPI to in-game sens, or resolution based maybe? not sure - 50 felt right for me).


I had nonexistent aim when I started since OW is pretty much my first fps I've played with mkb. Genuinely kinda wish I'd recorded my matches when I first started playing so I could compare it to now, but oh well. To start with, I mostly played D.Va, Reaper, wished I could be decent at Genji, and couldn't reliably hit a Pharah on 76. Now I main McCree and can hold my own in plat and against low dias.

Things I did:

- I had super high sens to start with (7000/15 since I didn't realise that the default sens being at 15 is really dumb; 7000 dpi is from playing mobas and rtses for years), so lowered that. In game sens to 7 (never changed this since), and then I lowered my dpi to 3000 or so -> 1800 -> 1200 -> finally to 800 which is where I'm at now. I originally stayed at 1200 for a good while, but then I realised I couldn't 180 properly since I wasn't arm aiming, and lowered my sens to 800, which forced me to arm aim. I would go lower, but this is the lowest sens at which I can still 360 without lifting my mouse, plus I play Genji/Tracer and this is also the lowest sens at which they don't feel weird/slow.

- For about 2 weeks straight I did training range drills for at least half an hour every day (reason being I couldn't play OW at the time, so I just practised aim instead). Mostly flicking drills iirc, with some tracking. I don't use the training range anymore since I got Aim Hero recently, but [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VysgMqzU3Qk) (the one at the start with the 6 bots) is the only drill I kept doing after that 2 week period.

- Like an idiot I kept playing heroes that don't rely on aim that much (Reaper/D.Va/Genji; only exceptions being Zen/Ana and they don't really count since my Zen aim was/is awful, and hitting teammates on Ana is easy), so all of the above didn't really make that much of a difference to begin with (my 76 did get a tiny bit better though). But then at some point in June or so I kind of accidentally started learning McCree and realised how awful my aim was (but muuuch better than when I first tried him). I was tilted af during the double exp event and decided to spam nothing but McCree and Hanzo in qp, who at the time were my worst heroes by far. For some reason ended up sticking with McCree in qp even after I got untilted. And then I started playing him a bit in comp. And then I played nothing but him in comp/qp, only switching/flexing if I really had to. And then I made a McCree only account (which is now a 'mostly McCree+Tracer+Genji, sometimes other heroes' account but oh well). And now I've got 3 times as much playtime on him as my second most played hero. I'm not gonna admit to how many hours I have on McCree since my aim is still not as good as it should be given just how much I've played him but yeah.

Tldr: fixed my dpi/sens, did aiming drills, found an aim-reliant hero I really liked and just played a stupid amount of it.

Also like I said, I got Aim Hero recently. I pretty much just spam Medium Reflex, but what I do is set up a custom session with the same parametres as Medium, except I've got the target delay/lifetime set to 0.7s at the start of each practise session. And then I pretty much just gradually work my way down to 0.45 (the default time) and spam that for a while (I do something like 0.7s > 0.6 > 0.55 > 0.5 > 0.45). Reason being that I'd rather start out slow and accurate (90% accuracy on 0.7s), and then work my way up to being faster. Ideally I'd be able to start at 0.6 or 0.5 instead of 0.7, but eh. I'll get there.

Edit: almost forgot. I also have my resolution set to 75% with high textures and low everything else. So I've got a constant fps of 120. But honestly the 75% res thing is what's helped the most, it's ridiculous how much better the game felt.

Also FFA is the best game mode. I think I've played a total of 2 qp matches since it came out. I dunno, it's amazing for me since in qp I'd usually try and find the highest elo player on the enemy team, or just the most annoying one or whatever, and go and duel them constantly. Now I can do that to everyone, all the time, without fucking my team over. It's both been amazing for getting better/quicker at aiming on McCree, and also for learning how to duel people on Tracer/Genji since I used to be absolutely awful at that (I'm still awful, but much less so).
Warm-up everyday.  Run yourself through tracking targets and flicks of varying distance across your screen during warm-up.  Work on muscle memory.  Play a lot.

That's the best way.  
try sensitivity find out what you like and dont change repeat. try fore arm on desk, elbow on desk, try being 45° to your desk. learn the range of motions and where your natural strengths are. 
My hitscan aim improved a lot and became more consistent to be played at a GM/Top 500 level by lowering my sens to 800 4.5.

Then i played with it a lot lot lot and can play Genji with it aswell.
Only thing i would need to improve with aiming even more is get a actual gaming PC.
Played way too fucking much Overwatch.
I've done several things that have helped drastically improve my aim 

- lowered my DPI from 1200 to 800
- lowered in-game sens from 13 to 6
- turned mouse acceleration off (yikes)
- started using my whole arm to aim instead of just my wrist
- practice flick shots against training bots and then Ana bots
- practice in QP

All of these changes were great for helping me build the necessary muscle memory required to effectively play heroes like Hanzo, Ana, and McCree. It definitely did take some getting used to, but I made noticeable improvements after only an hours or so.
Its not rocket science. Pick a sens youre comfortable with and play the game. Thats pretty much it.

Of course you can adjust your setup and your settings to get less input lag for example. However, these things dont suddenly make your aim better. Theres simply no shortcut which is why a lot of people struggle.
I had shit aim. But now it's not terrible. Honestly the biggest thing I've done that really helped is not to begin shooting then look for your target. But instead to find your target and place your cross hair on them and then begin shooting. Also shoot relaxed. Being tense doesn't always mean quick reflexes or whatever 
I played a lot of games and didn't put too much pressure on myself in each game.


I lightened my mouse by taking a battery out.
I just dropped my graphics settings to low, increased my DPI to 1600 with my sens at like 3 and just those two things upped my game a lot. I always thought because I have a 980ti that I could use high settings and get away with it, but I guess not. I get pretty salty because I've always seemed to have this ceiling where I couldn't get better, land my shots, etc. It seems way better now.
I find training bots too predictable in their movement for any serious practice. I always do super well when playing against training bots on hitscan heroes.
Pretty much what I did with only playing comp and quickplay. Focus on slowly aiming targets and then speeding up. 

Went from silver mccree (avg of 10 elims per game session) to masters/gm. 

There isn't a secret sauce. I had no experience with fps/pc games. Just played slowly and focused on aiming 

Your last point I think is underestimated. People place too much value on the Sr. If you are so afraid to lose it because of the fear of getting it back then you were never meant to be at that rank. It's inflated. I know I am at a bare minimum master player (never tried playing past it due to life) BECAUSE I know I can easily climb back up there no matter where I drop. Thus I can say I am a masters. Just play the game
I think stressing out about winning, whether I'm really contributing in the team, especially as DPS, makes me a poor DPS. When I play tank or support, I don't have this pressure of having to overthink my actions because.. I don't know why. I think I might try muting voice comms thing. 
> As of today, my aim sits at around 73-76%

That's very high. Higher than many famous Ana players actually. I looked it up [a while ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchUniversity/comments/64j73j/why_do_people_laugh_at_mercy_players_on_here/dg2vq6a/). With the new season and the fact some of them haven't even started the new season the current profiles aren't really reliable, but the ones that have time on Ana have an accuracy percentage in the low seventies. So if yours is 73-76%, that's impressive. But it could mean that you focus too much on accuracy and as a result not fire enough shots.

I agree with your comment though. That's the way to improve.
Can you link me to that post please? My aim has been awful since the last update. 
Yeah death match helped tonnes, I used to have a hard time with McCree v Genji, but after dying uncountable times to Genji's in death match, it's now 50/50 :/.... 
This?

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kwyNgZL6so
I hear you dude. I have a 1080 and it feels backwards playing on low when I can breeze the game on ultra. But frame latency is a thing, and the more frames the better :D
In my opinion/experience, you can't practice prediction on anything other than players. However, the fact that bots move in predictable ways means you can isolate specific mechanical actions that you are screwing up in game. 
So much this. 100% why I found my mains in Zenyatta and DVA. For Zenyatta orbs and being alive to use orbs are bare minimum to contribute. Poor aim? Spam chokes and melt tanks with body shots and nobody will blink an eye. Zero pressure and that fact alone is scary powerful for me at least. Honestly I can successfully land more shots on pharah as Zen than I can on Soldier. 

 As zen, straight up Icing a Pharah to force a switch, without a hitscan on your team,  is what I imagine cocaine feels like. Miss badly and nobody says anything except to tell junk/reaper to switch to hitscan. 

Same with dva. Stay in mech, use matrix for the ults/burst dmg, protect the supports. Launch ult (at a reasonable time ) and kill 0 people? Nobody says jack because you have already saved half their lives multiple times. No pressure, but get a nasty ult and it's smiles all around. 

But man, a bad earth shatter, or pharah alive after a couple 3 round burst shots on soldier, and you'll get asked to switch or berated mercilessly 

Edit: tldr for rant. Expectation level and team performance can impact my aim big time If you take comp too seriously. Confidence is a big factor 
Here is the post: https://www.reddit.com/r/OWConsole/comments/6x1f6n/after_extensive_testing_i_have_found_control

I don't use their settings, though. Here are mine:

Vertical and Horizontal Sensitivity: 100
Aim Assist Strength: 100
Aim Assist Window Size: 24
Aim Smoothing: 33
Aim Ease In: 50
Aim Technique: Linear Ramp

Try those out and let me know, although everyone is different and you might need to change some things. Don't be afraid of the 100 sensitivity; try a few deathmatch games and then mess with em. 
Very impressive! Sometimes, getting one headshot is all it takes for your opponent to back off. If you match up with someone of equal skill as Genji, you basically ignore Flashbang and Deflect and it comes down to sheer ability and movement.  

As a reminder to everyone reading this: Don't forget -- a headshot that makes Genji back off is a decisive victory in the game of Overwatch. Remember that training your aim is to hit a player when you want to hit them, not necessarily to kill them in all circumstances and situations.

That's the one!
You do know that G-sync basically cuts out input lag right? Frame latency also isn't going to affect your game very much at all, even if you are a pro player IMO. There's no need to push 300 frames 24/7. FPS dips are fine even below 144 because of your G-sync monitor, it's just not ideal

TL;DR: Play on ultra if you like it looking pretty, it won't affect your gameplay substantially
G-sync cuts display lag down as much as possible. Lowering your setting cuts the system lag, as in how after you push shoot, how long it takes for the internal simulation to process and pipe that data to your graphics output. People get a system lag of like... 20 ms? and without G-sync display lag is massively variable, but a rough estimate is around 5-15. IIRC G-sync cuts display lag to like 2 or something ridiculous.

Then there's network ping and server side lag compensation processing too...
Isn't the system lag you're talking about just the time it takes to render a frame? 20 ms is a ridiculous amount of lag, man.
To be brief, I mean the interal SIM value. You can check yours with ctrl+shft+N in game. Some people have Sim scores lower than 5, and some have over 30. Mine sits at around 14.
this.

How To Adjust To Less Sensitivity
Tl;dr: How does someone adjust to significantly reducing mouse sensitivity, or what sort of practice outside of gameplay could I do to help familiarize myself with lower sensitivity?

So, I'm not really sure why, but ever since starting Overwatch I've had it on weirdly high sensitivity and honestly never really noticed (for context, I started playing at launch). I'm not bad at Overwatch (got to Masters last season), and even as far as accuracy goes I'm generally in the top quarter of players for the hero on Overbuff. However, I aim like a fucking meth addict, and now that I know that that's my big issue, I'm trying to figure out how to go for a much lower sensitivity. I was at around an 11 when I had a wireless mouse and no mouse pad (no laughing, I had no money for a better one at the time) and now I'm around a 7 usually, but I can still clearly see that I need to go way lower. I just need an idea of where to start and if anyone has any pointers on getting used to that lower level. Thanks in advance!You should be able to do a 180 comfortably on your playing space, emphasis on comfortably. I went from 15/2650 to 4.5/400 and it was just playing more so I can adjust to it

I'm 4353 sr for reference, play alot of Winston 76 and Ana 
Play more
I move mine around depending on what I'm maining in the season. Im playing a lot of tanks(monkey/Dva didn't need much accuracy rather be able to do faster 180s) and supports this season and less Soldier/McCree so I'm at 800/5.2. But I used to use 800/3.X. 

The current one also feels better when I play Tracer and Pharah which are the only DPS I've been playing this season really. 
I used to play at 2000 dpi and default sens. I'm now down to 1600 dpi and 2.08 sens. Just play more.

That said, this video has helped some folks: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRFWLJazYYo
A big mouse pad helps a lot, but my best advise is to slowly move it down and see what works best
Ok. What kind of sensitivity would you recommend/use?
i don't recommend slowly moving down, you'd have to adjust a hundred times and never get a good feel about it

just jump into the cold water put it down to a good low value and then play a ton with it until you get used to

best start with something that matches a 360° to one width of the mousepad
Idk dude i use 2.7 800 dpi (same as in csgo) and i got used to it . Just play more and try to find your own sens
Shit, I'm playing at like a 1500 dpi and 7 sensitivity. Hence the shaking like a meth addict.
Play more. No for real there s no guide for shit like that. You get used to less or more.

Soldier 76 and some tanking VOD Help on PS4
https://youtu.be/5x18DZ9FIa4

The video starts with me trying to tank properly which is a big failure. I thought I did really good as 76 on defense, though of course, my dumbass auto-pilot lost us the game. I just want to know if my soldier game was really good. I don't mind a tip or two on tanking, it's obvious I failed miserably so any advice is very welcome.

I'm by no means a pro, but as someone who plays quite a lot of soldier I think you did really well for the most part with your positioning. As Soldier you're not a frontline attacker or a flanker like Tracer/Reaper. You should be playing off the high ground and picking off targets, which brings me to my next point - Target Priority.

 You didnt really make any huge errors here, but just remember, soldier isn't the most effective at shredding tanks so priority should generally be on; 1-Healers/Supports, 2- 200 HP Heroes, 3-Everyone else.

The biggest mistake I noticed was your tendency to shoot at Heroes that are being actively healed by mercy, and Zarya shields. All this does is feed Mercy and Zarya Ults. You should always try to kill the support before attacking anyone being supported.

Also I don't reccomend getting into 1v1's with heroes like Genji or Tracer. There so hard to hit as a hitscan, and they do so much damage your odds of winning are terrible. Try to regroup with your team and let them help you out if you can.

Hope something I said helped :)

Is getting an ALT (Smurf) worth it?
I think I might actually place higher that way, fresh start - playing my best. Does it actually work that way tho?If you wanna do it to get a higher rank: don't even bother. Despite everyone shouting how broken matchmaking is it actually does a pretty good job at ranking you where you are supposed to be. You'll simply end up where you are now.

If you want to broaden your hero pool however, feel free to get an alt. I suck at DPS and support and got myself an alt for the very sole reason of practicing those heroes without butchering my main's SR (and borderline throw matches for my fellow teammates)
I just consider it an alternate account since the system places you where you belong pretty fast. It was worth it for me because it made me approach the game a lot calmer and not tilt. I also was able to learn and master new heroes that I wouldn't normally get to play on my other account 
Yes. I have 3 accounts and i'll tell you from experiance, some days you just don't want to play on your main account. maybe people are super toxic that day, or you lost 2 and don't want to lost any more SR for your main but you still want to play Comp. Say you want to learn a hero better but aren't as good in your normal SR but you will do better at the lower SR alt account, this is where you learn.. QP can only take you so far and with an alt account you can learn and play at that level more normally and usually better anyway then the lower SR people so you'll fine. if your ALT account actually places higher than your main.. then switch roles, make your ALT your main, then have fun with your Main as if it was your ALT.  I bought a new account when i was stuck in bronze and i placed Gold 2275 and then i climbed to plat at the end of the season in that account and now in diamond with that same ALT account.. and my other account is bouncing around in Silver and I play a lot of Heroes i never normally play, because it's fun and I still win a good 60% of my games with those off heroes.. it's worth it man, a lot.. plus it's a lot less stress when you want to play comp but not care as much, i'm not saying to no try hard, you should every time try to win, but because you have two accounts or more, you won't be so tilited when you lose some SR on your account that you know is lower than your other one anyway.
I think it's worth it once you have a reason to play both accounts.  I have friends who play at different levels in the game (and some cannot even play with each other).  Playing with one group over the other can be punishing on SR gains. 

If SR is that important for you (nothing wrong with that approach) and the game price isn't an issue then what does it really hurt? Might as well give it a shot.  Good luck either way.
I think it's awesome. I have two accounts, one high plat low diamond with soldier, and one with all other heroes at low plat high gold. If I played any of the other heroes on my main but soldier, I'd basically be throwing.
IF the problem you're having is shit teammates who don't communicate, then yeah, a fresh start will probably benefit you. If you get down to Bronze or silver, it can be profoundly difficult to climb back out. I have had games where I wipe the enemy team multiple times and the rest of my team just hangs back too scared to capitalize on the opening. I've also had games where I heal or tank through tens of thousands of points of damage, but it doesn't matter because the rest of my team can't secure any kills. There is a point at the low ranks where the lack of communication gets so bad that you literally can't carry through it, unless you're like a GM genji or widowmaker smurfing.

but if you're at like gold/platinum and not ranking up, that's probably just where you're at skill-wise.
It's good if you want to try out new heroes without worrying about your rank or if your account's in Diamond+ and you can't queue with your friends.
If you have made a lot of improvement since initially making your main account then yes it will be easier to level up on an alt. As you play the game it calculates a hidden mmr (matchmaking rank). When you first start playing that number will increase or decrease faster because it will try to find your true mmr. But the longer you play and stay at one rank the more it will assume that you are at your true rank so the harder it will be to level up. What I found on my alt is that within a couple weeks I made it to the same level as my rank on my alt which took me multiple seasons to get. However once I reached my true rank it was just as hard to level up as it is on my alt. 

In my opinion the best use for an alt account is to have one account that you solo que on and one account that you play with your friends on. Especially if you are in masters or higher where you can only play with people within a 500 sr range. 
It's really nice to have another account, but I'll warn you though that it's actually HARDER to climb the higher you get.

On my alt I play(ed) against a lot of other low lvl accounts, and chances are higher they are smurfs the higher up you go in rank (a low level probably does not reach diamond+ if it's his/her first account). Given that I was technically not a smurf anymore after reaching diamond (my main is/was 3100-3200), it made for some pretty hard games to say the least ;). 
It increased my comp hero pool. Cos on alt you're free to try. Even if it's not one of your mains, but you feel like it's the right hero to pick - why the hell no. 

And also I use it when I want to play more, but feel a bit tired already. Before I got alt I'd just keep playing on my main acc. So, I guess, yep, it worth it.
Most of my friends achieved a higher rank with less playtime, but I haven't made that experience myself.
Let’s get this straight:

Smurf: you intentially place lower than your rank or derank in order to hard carry for fun. This ruins competitive

Alt: you either play outside of your hero pool to learn or youplay your regular hero pool. But this is for fair match making and learning so you don’t derank your main by playing hero’s you’re just learning. This is fine
I don't give a shit about trying to place higher on my alt and even then it was worth it for me. I did actually end up with a higher season high (2891 vs 2623 on my main), but my current rank is lower than my main (2510, main is 2604). This season I got placed 2807 on my alt, and 2602 on my main.

In my case I got an alt acc since I always duo with someone 500sr above me on my main, and genuinely felt like I was holding them down in comp, not to mention that I felt like my aim was beyond awful. So I got an alt account for onetricking McCree. And while my aim still isn't dia level, at least it's good enough for plat. I also did it to find out if I got carried out of gold, and while I might have, at least now I'm capable of getting myself into at least 2750.
I ended up with an extra 1000sr on my Smurf. At first it was nice but now I'm just annoyed that it came that easily. 
Exactly what bothers me, hmm i guess it isn't worth it then. cause the only reason is to try and get higher rank. i mean i've known a guy who  was stuck at diamond and then broke to masters after getting an alt
Depends on what you play, if you rely a lot on team you could deserve a higher SR, a player I play with is a Lucio player and he has a main account in gold but his new account placed In diamond
This is exactly why I got a smurf. It's kind of my test lab. The place where I can go and try out and work on heroes until I'm confident in them and able to play them on my main account. I'm a support main so I usually use it to work on my aim and DPS skills. 
Did you actually place higher tho? I really believe I deserve higher rank. I'm floating around 3k
Thanks!
This just frustrates the hell out of me, man. Please try not to take this personally, because it's a systemic issue. When I use the term "you" here, it is to "this guy", and not you personally 

It's a NOTICEABLE difference when people make these alts to play garbage heroes in our comp games a tier lower, just naturally more indifferent to the result because "lol whatever, I'm really diamond", and so I lose because you don't care as much and just want to play Sombra.

So I'm hypothetically equally as good as you, or at least in the ballpark, but I'm now another 20 SR further from catching you because you don't give a shit on your alt because "lol whatever I'm diamond anyway" and you paid $30 for the ability to ruin my comp games where I'm giving 110%. 

How am I supposed to climb running into at least one of these guys 70% of my games? It's why streaks are so wild for almost everyone. How many serious, committed, properly ranked teammates am I getting? Sometimes it's no one else, sometimes it's all 5. Luck of the draw. 
If you want to improve, review your vods. Get better and the number will follow, there is no shortcut. Put in effort or stay stuck, simple as that.

If you have a hard time spotting your own mistakes check out WaWas bootcamp, you can get free coaching there.
So, just because he broke masters doesn't mean that he is a masters player. You're going to have a natural fuzz around your rank. It's probably around ±100SR and then you have to account for streaks which might easily swing another 150 SR. You need to think about how much SR you think you're going to gain by having an alt. Think about how many games it takes to get it to 25, and compare it to whether if you just played those games on your main if you would be able to get to your goal. Think about your skins. Think about juggling accounts and the separate friends lists. Masters is great, but you'll fall if you're not good enough, and there's no guarantee that you'll actually place up there
I did this to get out of bronze a few seasons back, it took me to gold bro. i knew for a fact my mechanics and gamesense were SO much better then a bronze player, and I was right, but Phr3nic is right if you truly DO play at the level you're in and not leading in golds in the proper fields you're suppose to lead in for that hero, then you will get placed in a similar SR. The SR system isn't broken and their algorithms are pretty good at getting you to a place where they think you will have a 50/50 win rate. and remember your first few games (5-10 games) are super sized with SR gains and losses, so take them seriously and take breaks when needed, i have gained a good 400 SR in 8 games after placements because of this.
I will answer the question for you:. NO. It is NOT worth it and it is a waste of time 

You first five games you will crush and possibly feel bad as to how easy the game is. 

Then after 5 games you start getting matched with platinum players. Then five more games I'm back to playing with masters/gm players BUT THE QUEUE TIMES ARE AT LEAST FIVE MINUTES! 

The game does a good job getting you to your "true" MMR so it isn't like you are playing against easier opponents, and the queue times are super long on purpose to discourage alt accounts 

TL;DR: after 10 games you will be where you were except it will take an annoyingly long time to get into games 

I stopped trying to level up to level 25 bc for every real time hour i would finish maybe 3 matches 
Part of that might be there's less 'pressure' when playing on a smurf. 
I have 2 alts. One i bought myself and one from a friend who stopped playing after half a year. And both of the are exactly up at 3207, 3211 and 3348. So you should rank about the same in all your accounts if you really play at your SR. I like to split losses through my accounts tho. I start at first account and switch account once i lose. So i get rid of lossstreaks when they were still a thing
First time I did placements I placed right below plat instantly climbed to diamond with sombra on a 70% win. My other account is mid diamond to early master. I believe if I played my other account more I would surpass my original account, however I haven't put in enough of the time to try and get to masters with it. I use it more to learn the heroes I enjoy playing but never get the chance to play since ppl look at my hero pool and see supports and tracer. I doubt you'll place higher on first placements on new account unless you do absurdly good 
The chances of them being on the enemy team are much higher than them being on your team, since your team consists of 5 others while the enemy has 6. By your logic, you're getting boosted more SR than you are losing. You are just choosing to focus on losing SR. Also, everyone goes through these types of games, you are not alone and it is part of climbing.
I play mostly zarya on my alt, and when I do I usually get gold elims and team winning gravs. I'll also fill, and play rein, symm, and Mercy. Last game I played symm I was gold elims, damage, ptg. I do try. I want to rank up with zarya. I'd like to get my alt to diamond.

I think the only unfair thing is when I play soldier on the alt account because I really want to win for some reason. Then suddenly the enemy team is facing a smurf. I'm only 400SR higher, so I'm not unbeatable, but it usually is pretty unfair.
you're talking about quick play?
Yes. I completely gave up because after 4 weekends in a row of playing 4 hours a night I was only like level 17 or something. This was with a 70%+ winrate. 

It punishes you if they think you are on a smurf, even though it matches you with players of your MMR! 
Can someone confirm this? Seems weird that they'll punish people like that. I mean, someone REALLY good might play like that at first and the system will just punish him for no reason?
Go google it dude. This has been a known issue for a while now. Pretty sure Jeff even talked about it. 

Was a total waste of $40. I don't have the free time or patience to sit around waiting at LEAST 5 mins to *maybe* finish a QP match for some XP. 
the struggle is real

Perfecting dragonblade (Genji)
Alright, so I guess you guys have seen alot of threads about this guy already, he's been called a scripter and all that..

Anyway, I don't think he's scripting, and I wish I could improve my dragonblades and become as fast as this guy to pop off. Question is, HOW do I practice this? I know that he does 2 slashes and dashes backwards towards the next enemy in a split second. Been trying to practice this in both training room and against Ana bots, but it just takes alot of practice to nail completely. Any tips/tricks/techniques/ways to practice this efficiently? I'm willing to practice this 8h each day if it's gonna help me improve.

I'm not talking about "knowing" where u enemies are etc, I mostly got that down (currently 4.2k SR), what I'm talking about is the actual super fast 180 turnaround which is what I want to nail.

I use 3 ingame sens, 1600 dpi - I've been thinking about bumping it up but not sure it's worth it as I really got used to this sens.

https://youtu.be/hQIF4PVPUZc?t=4m38s

Any help is ofc appreciated :) always looking to improve my cyborg ninja after all these years of playing him ^^


Cheers!Up your sens. I sit at about 12 in game, 800dpi and is only for genji but worldly great. My dragon blades are good just because I can do an easy 180 on my mouse pad
Yeah I use 1000 DPi and 15 sens and its funny because almost everytime I dragon blade I do a 360 for no reason I think it might be because I'm trying to look for targets.
Higher sensitivity doesn't do too much. I play at 45/45 on console, a relatively low sensitivity for a controller. I've played at both 100/100 and 10/10. If you're on PC, you should definitely keep a low sens. Using a mouse means you don't have to worry about the speed you turn around, therefore your sens should be very low. 
I have a small mouse pad because of the desk space I can use and it helps because your dashes and ultimates feel way more fluid. Plus console from my experience feels way better at the same sens. I used 50/50 and did well

Something I have the biggest issue with, if you guys would like to give me some tips/feedback on, is staying patient. Tracer isn't a character that can fight enemies head-on. You also should play her in a sneaky and patient way, being an opportunist, or waiting for your teammates to engage, and then fuck their backlines. But I find myself sometimes playing too aggressive and not being patient. Also my lack of patience causes me to blink too prematurely. 

Should I wait for my team to engage before coming in on flanks? What if my teammates aren't engaging, or aren't aggressive, or just get picked before the fight has even started? I find Tracer the hardest to play when the team plays too passive, and waits for enemies to engage them. 

I just realized they are all KOTH maps which appear to be Tracer's strong maps. I'll make an effort to record 2 CP and Hybrid maps which are maps I have a lot more trouble in because of the lack of apparent brawl locations. I would love to give you some reviews but the main issue here is i am almost the same sr as you, i have 65 hours with tracer (second most playable hero) 
I watched your first video and your problem is you're really bad at range control and very bad at knowing where you're going to aim at your blink

You're always dead center of the fight.  Furthermore because you're always so unsafe you can't get your full damage out because you're always afraid and blinking around. 

Tracer 's effective range is like 10 -15 meters but you constantly go too close to the targets then spazzing out

Also you need to work on your ult econony. You throw your ult or wildly. 
 
I think that's totally okay. I have like.. 5 hours on Tracer - 2 hours on Comp
Ok i will watch them when i wake up, i need to sleep right now

I will check them and review it 

Questions on Tracer in Season 6
Hey Tracer Mains, I've been having trouble with all the spam in the Season 6 "meta." (I'll say that this based on my experience in Gold and Silver). 

It seems with the changes to Junkrat, McCree, Zarya, Orisa, etc. there's just a lot of things that can catch you out, and with Tracer's low HP it usually means a death. How are you dealing with these changes? Are you flanking more? Are you staying back with your team more? Are you still focusing on healer's first? Or are you looking to take out your counter first? 

Thanks in advance for any responses! A lot has to do with your comp. as tracer, if you teammates can't capitalize on odd man fights or players with their back to them, you are gonna get focused.

This is not meant to be a my team sucks comment, but I've noticed that junk just doesn't secure kills, or reaper, or rein, or diva... and so on. 

They move so slowly that they can't really do anything with 5 seconds of hey no one is shooting at us.

I'm just barely in plat, so grain of salt to be taken
I find I don't engage as often unless my recall is available. And I will avoid McCree all together unless they've 100% already used their flashbang.

Not a tracer main btw, I've just been playing her a bit recently. 
Tracer had definitely become much harder to play, from my experience at 3800. What I changed from last season was: 1. Not playing tracer as much, junkrat and solider are taking up more of my time. 2. When I do play her against counters, I make sure to focus then down quick, usually asking my other DPS/Diving tank to help cause chaos. 3. I use high ground a lot more, making it so I can jump back line and still recall to somewhere completely safe. Good luck!
Tracer has definitely become less viable in this spam meta. Like others have said, you need to adapt your playstyle based on your team comp. If you have a slow sieging comp (Reinhardt, mcree, orisa, zarya) then it's best to play patiently and avoid dying by going in 1v6 when nothing is happening. Likewise, if you have a Winston diving in, the space is created for you and be sure to utilize his bubble and kill as much as you can. Its very hard to flank as tracer when your team is slow and you have to create space for yourself to make plays, unless you are already much better than your team. 
Counters first always unless a situation asks otherwise. You shouldn't be engaging until your team and their team have committed to the fight. How you position yourself before the fight is preference ie with your team or  the enemy back line. 


I play tracer mostly (was in 30's on overbuff last I looked). Used to be a hog main but rip :...( . 

The difficulty you are going to feel definently scales with what your comp/what your teammates are doing. I played a koth game recently with 3dps+ a solo tank hog. The other team had a more meta 2-2-2 compositon. It is going to be very hard for anyone on your team that is not a flanker to even press W (the hog will be melted while feeding ult).   

In situations like that you can either go in first or stand at choke with your team till you lose. I typically willl go in first. As you would expect you'll take a lot of focus and it will be difficult. So you can either deal with that or fill on another hero in that scenario. Even if you have a meta comp, you might still feel a lot of pressure from the enemy team if your team isn't really drawing any attention. 

Situations like that have always been rough though, so that isn't unique to s6.

Junkrat should not be killing you unless you are forcing a fight where you are disadvantaged. If you take a fight with him in an enclosed space where he is advantaged, get trapped, or walk into random spam, you misplayed. 

Mcree is not really harder to fight than last season. You need to understand how to bait a flash, and have good enough movement to not make hitting you easy. Google for general tips dueling mcree. It should not be an issue for you.

Zaryaa/orisa? what issue r u having.

Typically I'll fight with my team. If that works, great. If it doesn't seem to be working well, then I will approach the game differently, flanking or maybe taking more individual fights.

Picking a healer is always good. You need to be able to do it with some efficiency and consistancy for it to be worthwhile though. If you cant track a lucio well enough to kill him with some efficiency, you are probably better off shooting the tank. If that is the case your time would be better spent working on mechanics than worrying about target priotization though.

I don't really feel like a specific hero can counter you. If anything teamplay will hurt you the most, like if you have a dva activly focusing you with matrix to minimize your impact. If you have a hanzo with a mercy powerboost letting him scatter you with a large margin of error. If enemy team has a zen perma discording you.  ect

IDK how long youve been playing but you are a pretty low rank. You'll benefit most from just grinding the game, testing out different approaches you come up with, and working on mechanics. You can be a braindead vegetable and you will climb out of gold with a bit of mechanical improvement so I would put your focus on that and not the type of stuff you are asking about.

This situation is pretty much why I stopped playing Winston. I was getting focused immediately because everyone knows that's what you're supposed to do. But somehow my team could never compromise on that space. 

With Tracer I feel like it's the same. Once you see the enemy has a Tracer, you are always on the look out for them. Couple that with all the trash damage being thrown around, and it's just a tough time for Tracer. 
McCree is a super easy target. Very predictable to bait out that flashbang. Don't avoid him, shoot him a bit, wait for him to turn and notice you, then blink back, then forward to him again after he uses it. Unless he starts hitting his flashbang, I kill mccrees.
When do you make that decision to stop playing Tracer? What conditions indicate that you should switch? 
It sounds like you aren't engaging at the right time with either character. Watch the indicators over your teammates heads if you are flanking behind as tracer and try not to engage unless the enemy is at least somewhat distracted. 

If you start shooting them, or jump in as Winston, and your team isn't also already there engaged in the fight then of course they're going to focus you down
Fair enough. That's good advice. I tend to play a little too aggressive and it gets me killed. 
That works both ways tho, if you can engage and escape it gives your team a chance to engage favorably. 

It really comes down to what style best suits the team you have... I've had teams of 5 held at a choke by a solo Orissa, and I've had junk rats that wipeout both tanks as soon as the healers are distracted.

Tracer to me can be great if you can figure out what will help your team. Sometimes, the difficulty in assessing your teams needs is harder than 1 vs 1 a soldier on a healing station.
Timing when to start the fight is one of the more important skills to have. It's easier to see what's happening as a support (which I end up playing a lot) which is why I have a decent feel for it when playing tracer.

Example - let's say you're on attack. if your whole team is pushing right and you are flanking left, if you engage the fight 3-5 seconds before they do you'll probably die. The other team will just turn and focus you if they have nothing else to worry about at the moment. If your team starts to push and you engage 1 second after you may kill someone before they even realize your there.


I'm referring to engaging before your team is ready to engage. Then you are creating an opening for no one. You risk your life for no benefit. I see players do this all the time even at relatively high ranks.

You may even accidentally encourage your team to push into a situation without an advantage.

Example: 2nd point on offense on any 2CP (like hanamura). The spawn is super close for defenders. Your team is regrouping to push top right. 3 people are waiting by the entrance at the top right. 2 teammates are respawing/coming back. You, as tracer are flanking left. You go in and get a kill. The 3 see that and push. But they just pushed into a 4v5 because you still have two coming back from spawn and those 2 will probably be back around the same time or just after the person you killed.

Not sure if I explained that example well but it's a little hard to explain.
Nope, I get it... we are in agreement

EDIT: I just realize all these are KOTH maps. I should upload Hybrid and CP maps because I find them to be my weaker ones. GM McCree/S76/Tracer player here. Even tho' you are a decent Tracer, you still make some rookie mistakes.
  
* **Fighting enemy head on.**   
Tracer was not designed to fight at the frontline. She's pure flanking hero and I couldn't really see you flanking in that video. You had a lot of the oppurtinities and you didnt took them. 7:01 minute shows you jumping into enemy team straight on, when theres safe way around right side. Yes - it did paid off but that was a gamble and you must learn to minimalise the risk.  

* **Focusing wrong targets**  
3:37 Shooting a Hog who's getting healed by two healers at the same time. You shouldnt focus on him, I know it looks like he has low health, I know he's easy to hit - but - 2 x 200HP healers are just healing his ass and they are not being attacked by anyone. Free healer ult charge yay! You should insta focus them, preferably Ana cuz Zen was behind the Hog and there were chances that Ana would just back off behind the wall (free cover for you). She was out of nade, she cant really hit you with her sleepdart if you know what you are doing and you can't really get killed by her rifle if you keep on moving. Squishes should **fear** you. They should feel your breath at their backs 24/7.

* **Underestimating Zenyattas**  
Zen players just look harmless to flankers. One headshot and boot to your face = you get to see the spawn once again. If you are fighting Zen (or anyone tbh) try to blink behind him so he actually has to do 180 degree turn instead of just moving his wrist to left or right. That can make him a bit confused for a second, its even better if you time your blinks perfectly: blink behind him, when he's rotating blink back where you came from and one clip him.  
  
* **Painting around players**  
You need to work a bit on your tracking. Tracking is harder than flicking but after a while you should be able to land most of your shots. It still can be hard when everyone (including you) is moving but practice makes perfect! Also - learn how to pre-aim for baby Dva.
  
That's basically it. You need to start playing as a flanker, less like S76. I do like your gamesense, you know when to back off (like when your team is wiped, you just dont try to 1v5, sounds obvious but its not) You should be enemy squishies nightmare. Think of it like being a mosquito at night when they are comfy in their beds. If you can't kill them you'll distract them and/or make them slap their own faces ;) Distraction/keeping pressure on someone is just as good as fragging.  
I wanted to make a video review but shame you pasted part1 twice, also I don't think you'd understand my "Engrish".  
Good luck in S6!
I have limited experience here because I'm a support main but I am in master. Now that that's out of the way though I skimmed through the vid a little bit because I don't have time right this second to watch the whole thing but one tip I think can help you is to take more flank routes and focus on the backline because I saw you shooting the tanks a lot. Even if you can't kill the supports they're forced to either defend themselves or die and both choices are ideal for your team. If they focus on you then they aren't healing the team, if they die well then they aren't healing the team, no healing cripples the whole team and if both supports are dead then they need to regroup. Seeing as it's plat though they will most likely keep fighting and stagger themselves or wipe and be forced to regroup. Keep in mind because you're playing tracer if you do kill a support you can camp them at spawn too, iirc sinatraa does this so there's some tape you can watch to know what I mean, which again cripples the team and forces them to have to deal with you or be down a support. If they are running only 1 support then that makes your job even easier and makes spawn camping an even better idea. But again take this with a grain salt however I do have experience with being spawn camped and be constantly harassed since I play support lol, hope this help regardless and good luck.
Your tracer game is really good :D I'm not good enough myself to coach or give feedback but I noticed that both links goes to part 1 video and I can't find part 2 to watch :(
From what I've seen so far, the only thing I can currently tell you: Your tracking is quite OK, but you should really start working on hitting headshots now.

I think you've practiced hitting bodyshots more than enough, now aim a little higher and get more *dinks*. I don't have enough experience on Tracer to give any more advice apart from that ...
You're a little too impatient with your blinks. You need to watch who's watching you so that you can get into those sweet spots to kill supports. Work on your game sense. Your aim is good and your mechanics are very decent. It's all game sense from here. 
Similar to what /u/A_legal_alien mentioned; you're doing a pretty decent job outputting damage, and your ults are fairly effective. Overall, you're doing a fairly good job harassing without dying. My biggest issue is that their back line went pretty much uncontested in these links for the most part. The only time you ever really target their healers is when there is a big fight already happening and they are close to it.

Use flanking opportunities to your advantage. In high plat/low diamond, people tunnel extremely badly, and when a tracer is off the screen, people usually tend to keep doing what they were doing before you harasssed them. Very rarely do you get cohesive teamwork to target a good tracer, unless you're badly overextending without some other form of map pressure. Any harassment onto their healers makes them less effective at healing, more paranoid about where you are, and overall less coordinated with their team. But still a pretty solid first round that you linked.
What 2 others have said, stop the focus on the tanks (unless it's called out to focus them down). Hit that zen for an easy one clip. Bother Ana so she stops focusing on healing her team. Once one is out, your team should have the advantage. You looked pretty good overall. High plat/diamond looks about right to me.
More focus on headshots and one-clipping, also I would say you sometimes fire on your enemy too early leading to them seeing you before you get into really effective range. Personally I often run closer to not make the sound of blink and then empty my clip into them before they have time to react. (Like 4:21 part 1).

Get better at using recall when you take damage, you play a bit too reckless around their zenyatta sticking around with ~50hp and recall ready to use. Wait for recall to be ready, dive in try to get a kill then if you take damage fuck off straight away, not worth risk dying.

Also play more behind the enemy, harass the players going from their spawn to their team and use the packs there to stay alive, you can cut off reinforcements and poke them for annoyance and occasional one clip tries or bombs.
I'd say generally wait to fire until you're closer to people. For example at 4:22 you see a Zen alone, and you fire a clip from so far away you probably did like ~15 damage. All this really did was alert Zen to your position and intentions. If you instead blinked up to him and unloaded in his face before he even knew you were there it would have been more effective. You do this a few other times.

When a fight is broken out, feel free to spray from a distance and put out some damage. But if you see an opportunity to surprise someone, try to maximize the initial burst damage.
Which server do most of the people here play on. 
Thank you SO much for the comprehensive review. I love the criticism because it means I have a lot more to work on. I uploaded two more maps and fixed the part 2 of Ilios. Appreciate more feedback :) And feel free to use my videos for a video review - I also don't mind Engrish haha.
Spawn camping is a good point. I guess I never do it because in a high stakes environment like competitive, I saw that as a risk of just feeding by going too deep. I'll definitely keep this in mind - thanks!
Woops - updated =D Thanks for pointing it out. 
his aim is good. he needs to work on blink management, game sense, and positioning. 
I agree with that so much. I feel the need to blink as soon as enemies see me, which I think is starting to ruin my aim, because I am less patient with staying in spot for too long, causing me to rush and just spray bullets everywhere. What is a good time to blink?
Thanks for the tips, especially the reminder to not pre-fire which attracts attention. It's definitely a bad habit from 76 and other DPS roles. 
What do you mean? This was in an NA server 
Looking back at it I made it seem like a priority when it really isn't. It's a high risk high reward strat but it'd be a better idea to just do your best to be a pain in the ass of the squishies. 
When you're pressured by a real threat. 
Best of luck. :)

I appear to be stuck around high platinum, low diamond as a support main. Could there be something I'm missing to advance up?
I'm a Lucio main (can play Mercy if needed) with currently 2893 sr, and 3089 sr for a season high 8 hours played this season on PS4. Unfortunately I appear to be having trouble getting higher in sr for the past couple seasons, so I believe I'm stuck. I do feel I play better with a full group that knows what they're doing, but that's rare. Is there anything different I should do to get better and win more games? Maybe just practice more, or find groups? Without seeing some of your gameplay it's gonna be hard to give you advice on how to improve. But since you play on PS4 it's pretty easy for you to record your play and then post it to Youtube. Then you will be able to post links of your gameplay on this reddit so others can help you. 

I will end by suggesting that maybe you can try picking up Zenyatta. If played well, Zenyatta and his discords can wreck an enemy team. 
record your gameplay and post it here for a vod review. i'm not amazing or anything but i've been mid-high masters season 4,5 and 6 so i'd give you some advice if i saw some gameplay :) i play a lot of lucio, mercy and zenyatta.  

I was stuck in diamond for a while as a support main. And my tip to climbing is to just keep playing, try to get better like always.
I also recommend duoQ with someone who can play dps and tank well, this makes matchmaking feel less like rng because you have at least 1 good teamate. TrioQ also works, but I wouldn't recommend 4,5,6 stacking since it can lead to unbalanced matches...
I really recommend finding ppl to play with since it's next to impossible to carry as support, especially with dive comps being strong...
As someone who was a strict support main for s1-4(averaged where you are now, peaked at 3489), youre gonna have to learn 1 dps. Learn 1 DPS and master it harder than any other character, thats what helped me really settle into 3300 or so and thats around where I stay ( peaked 3670 s5)
I struggle with a lot of things at my elo. I used to be low Plat and I fell to silver slowly but steadily this season because my placements were fcked up by blizzard themselves.

The most problems that I am facing now, that I didn't face for the last two season are

Koreans. - no communication at all, can't even play around them cuz they keep changing heroes like they are trying on clothes at a mall.

Weird team comps - I don't know why we would go hanzo, widow, Mei, and sym when they have a good pharah and our widow hits butterflies. I stopped playing cree cuz of this reason and playing hog as I was told it was one of them heroes that I can have the most impact with.
You can try learning hog or zarya as they are self sufficient heroes who punish the enemy for making mistakes. 

As Lucio keep your speed on most of the time unless your heal is required to quickly save someone. Play him like an ambulance. 

Ana learn how to quick scope. Believe me that 0.5second matters.. (on scope her rifle becomes hitscan) 

Zenyatta discord important targets. (your dps having trouble killing pharmercy? Discord the pharah.!) 

Mercy I don't play so..... 


Lastly while playing supports try to play in a group, don't be a fool(me) and play soloq like me. A good dps or tank can do wonders with two or three people playing around them. 

I know you are of a higher elo but I hope this helps somewhat! Good luck. Peace out. 
I've actually been uloading videos ever since I started playing in October. Haha, here's the playlist for the newest: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1Hie2IWhC2gnOkfwrJF2Yu9d4dujEZsW&disable_polymer=true
I also livestream sometimes.

I do quite decent with Zenyatta, I'll try playing him a little more.
Here's the beginning of me playing competitive more recently. https://youtu.be/3s4-YQVJbjk?t=52m34s Review away!
I'm actually LIVE right now if you like to observe. https://www.twitch.tv/spyrokid77666 If not, I'll be sure to stream more and upload them to YouTube. www.youtube.com/spyrokid77666
And don't let it be Junkrat... Junkrat is my only dps and thus leaves me alone to deal with pharmercy, since no-one else is good enough to do so
coming up as private for me.
I'll peep and leave feedback. I'm a masters support and tank main
Whoops, sorry, try again now?
Thanks guys :)
Yep, works now! Also, I approve of your name. Youre a true playstation OG
Haha, thank you very much! :) 

2695 SR Ana/Lucio VOD review request
Hi! Let me begin by saying that I don't know how to download a streamed video from Mixer. Here is the VOD: https://mixer.com/ArGM2015?vod=7779221

Thank you for taking the time to read.
FFA - You're Widowmaker and there's a Genji charging at you, how do you deal with him?
I've been playing a lot of Widow in FFA, and I can seem to always be in Top 4, and am pretty decent at getting most of my targets, except when it comes to Genji and Sym. I always lose that battle. A Genji will notice me and start to charge at me. I'll do some pop shots to get him to activate reflect, but it ends with ninja stars to the face, and a slash through my body and after turning around he last thing I see is his face going tsk tsk tsk. I always lose this battle. Is there a good strat besides avoiding? I can't help it, after getting killed by one I always constantly seek him out to see if I can get revenge. 

Either 1) Get a lucky headshot, 2) Be a widow god and get a intended headshot, 3) Emote and hope he goes away.
Step 1: throw venom mine next to you.    75 damage
Step 2 :body shot him once.                    120 damage
Step 3: hit one bullet (unscoped).           13 damage

Total damage done:                                 208 damage
Mine + SMG is enough to deal with a Genji who doesn't get a jump on you.
You can try to hit him while dashing (not as reliable, but his head hit box gets enormous), or what I do, which is grapple as high as I can. When he hits deflect, that gives you time to line up a shot. Genji widow is kind of a crapshoot either way, but it's doable. And what the other guy said about the mine and body shot is probably the most reliable 
I like to venom mine, bait reflect by scoping in, then when he dashes(they ALWAYS dash after reflect), I grapple on floor away from him and line up a shot. Hopefully either I get the hs or he triggered the mine, if you can at least land the bodyshot, smg him to victory or emote/spray after the *dink* if u landed it. Prepare for his salty return, and repeat.
grapple away, try to get in shot
1) Try to hit a shot before he uses the deflect

2) Put a venom mine near you if hes about to dash

3) Since no deflect, just use ur smg to kill him.

There is one trick you could try. A lot of genji's after noticing you will deflect, and soon after they will swift strike. If your cross hair was following/on him while he was deflecting just fire. More often than not it will be an instant hs as he is going right towards you, head first, if he is swift striking
Fight:


1)  Fire the charged shot, hopefully at least hitting the body.  It's unlikely he'll both time the deflect correctly AND be able to send it back at you, but it IS possible.  Still, it's worth the risk.


2)  Drop mine near the engagement


3)   Spray with Widow's Kiss while dodging and force him to trigger the mine or direct a moment's attention to kill it.

Flight:
GTFO with your grapple ASAP, preferably towards your team.
Plant a mine between you both but not too close to you and immediately find higher ground with your hook. Turn and snipe him until he dies or switch to alt fire if he gets to you.
I've tried to memorize the duration of Genjis deflect... Sometimes I can hit him right as it ends
You have a few options depending on distance. 

Here is what I normally do:
1. Spider mine where you are standing.
2. SMG fire him and try to bait the deflect.
3. While he is stuck in deflect grapple away.

Also maximize your grapple distance and prepare a rebound shot off of it. (I know it sounds obvious, but a grapple 3M to the left will be a pain to work with.)

If a Genji spots me across the map I'll either try to SMG or shoot light body shots and bait that deflect.

I'd also recommend playing other hit scans, and practicing on burst firing (if you haven't already) 

The key to this is movement and composure. 
Practice it no matter what. Trying to adapt to what the Genji is doing will usually screw you up. 

As far as fight a sym goes... good luck. 
She is a pain no matter who you use......
Or 4) Panic and shoot the ground. I get hesitant on headshotting a Genji cause too often they reflect it back into my head. 
good genjis wont let you bodyshot that easily and venom mine isnt a secure 75 damage either
Awesome, I was wondering about numbers. I didn't think of using the mine offensively so lll try that to see if I get a better result!
Thanks I didn't think to use the mine offensively. 
Thanks I'll try to grapple method. 
Ahh good idea for the venom mine. Didn't think of using as part of an offensive extension. Do you also hook further behind?
Yes this is the only way I've been catching them lately. To me it happens because I believe the Genji hesitates for a split second. 
What about at close range? I've been trying a method today which has been semi successful. Where the Genji deflects and I'll hook in the direction he came from and turn around and hit a headshot because he slashed   

As for symmetra, today I didn't have that much of a problem because she throws up the shield and I'll just aim up and end up headshotting her. Unless I notice that she has the benefit from shield gen in which case I'll run away. 
You can cancel your scope with a melee and just use your SMG afterwards to kill genji
good widows will land the shot

at the end of the day, you have to land your shots to win on widow
Venom min isn't guaranteed 75 if they get a health pack. Which, if they do, they're going to negate most, or all, of that damage as well as stopping it. Since OP is referencing FFA DM then health packs are literally the only way you're going to get healed as Genji. In which case Genji has to disengage from the fight and you've now won your space to either kill him as he runs off or reposition so you have a better chance upon his next engagement.

So in effect, either Venom Mine *is* guaranteed 75 damage or Genji runs off which is probably the more prefer situation if you are confident in winning that engagement.
Grapple jump kills are the most satisfying thing in the game, so it's doubly beneficial! 
As far forward as you can after he dashes. You can spin, scope and adad spam faster than he can cover the distance to reach you again. You'll probably still get shurikened in the head, but you'll get a second 80-100% shot. Miss that one and he deserves to kill you.

(oh the number of times i've missed that shot)
Usually i do.

When a genji is coming from the jump pad near the cliff and i'm on the top, i tend to hook myself farther away to get a better shot.
yes, this thread is prerty usless. its one of those git gud topics.
Least satisfying is the grapple jump shot into the drink. 
I'm going to try this method tonight. I'm hoping that I'll just get hit with swift strike but catch him on the other side. Do you know if you take more damage if you are already turned around? My hope is that as soon as swift strike is coming I can just spin and already be set up for the shot. I'm hoping this is a foolproof method. You should see my face after every time I try to time deflect and end up sniping myself. 
The baseline for Widow is sort of a get good issue but there are ways to fine tune your performance. Body shotting Genji is much easier than headshotting Genji. As long as you don't have utter shit for aim then landing a body shot is elementary-level-math easy.

If you do have shit for aim on Widow then your priority shouldn't be "how do I deal with this [niche] situation?" It should simply be practicing aim.
Really a whole lot of the help topics on here just boil down to "get better"
>Do you know if you take more damage if you are already turned around? 

No, but Widow's head is one of only a few that's plainly visible from any angle. 
I realize the get good. But the situation are usually at a closer range than a little further away. Genji at a distance I usually have no problem with, I'll catch them on the jumps or the wall climbs. 

My aim isn't improving..
Saw a few aim post here and remembered to post this. I play the game a lot, like Silver portrait 3 stars, but still, I cannot figure out why I've hit some horrible plateau. From lvl0 to 3/4 stars, it definitely was improving quite well, went from gold to plat to diamond using DPS. Around this time, I switched my sens, fell to mid-plat understandably, so I switch back after almost 50-100lvls. I climbed to 3k and I can't break 3.2k, it's like for the past two competitive seasons I've been stuck there because my mechanics are just flat out won't improve. I try concentrating on improvinh flicks, since my tracking is quite bad since I switched back, and it doesn't help. I even downloaded Aim Hero and am 10 hours in with not very much improvement for that amount of time. It's frustrating as McCree Genji main. Does anyone have any tips or ideas or something?Honestly, it's all practice and patience.

You have to see it like this:

It's pretty easy for a new runner to improve his time on the track in the beginning. Let's say he cut his time down from 10min to 8min in a rather short amount of time. He is motivated by the improvement, but now it starts getting harder and harder to feel improvement, because the things needed to get an even better time are very nuanced and demand more time investment and dedication.

He is still improving, but now the work needed to improve his time has doubled, while the actual improvement will only be half of what it was before.
There's a difference between passively improving and actively improving. It's true that you have a silver portrait and hundreds of hours played, but how much of that time was spent actively trying to improve? A lot of us play the game on autopilot and autopilot is the worst way to get better at a game.

If you want to continue improving, you're going to have to play games a lot more actively. Turn off the auto-pilot. Ask yourself what your weaknesses are. Then play games to address those weaknesses.

It sounds like you're already trying to do this using Aim Hero. So congratulations. I will also add that it is very likely your efforts are misguided. I think most players hit their mechanical plateau in gold. From gold all the way up to masters, it's more about learning strategy, game sense, and positioning. I suggest you play Overwatch with those in mind. Start tracking ults, who's alive on which team, and what your job in the next push is. What ults should your team commit to the next fight? Are you winning the fight or losing the fight? Focus more on the big picture rather than your inidividual mechanics.

Also, start recording and reviewing your own game play. You can often see the mistakes you make a lot clearer in hindsight.
Are you using reasonable settings. Find something you like then stop switching. Also is your gear reasonably competitive (good framerate, ect). 

Know that it really is a grind. I had 500h of deathmatch/bot practice on csgo. You will improve more from dm'ing/conscious exercise than grinding mm. 

You can't half ass the effort you put in when you are trying to improve. Let's say you are playing a typical mm game. you might get a certain accuracy % stat for the game. 

The next game you put a shock collar on that is going to zap you 5x everytime you lose. If your accuracy stat for that game is a signfiicant amount higher, you are not putting enough effort into your typical game. 

I'm guesing most of your game time is in comp/qp. Your aim is not going to improve nearly as much when playing the regular game mode in comparison to more deliberate aim practice. The frequency of the fights you are taking is too low. I would do Deathmatch, custom match bots, and aim hero. You can experiment with different approaches within the three.

In addition to out of match aimprac/deathmatching go into a match and try your heart out to aim sick, even if it requires an uncomfortable amount of focus to do so. Every shot even the ones that seem unimpactful you need to hit like it matters. Your goal is almost to aim above ur norm more so than win. Do that for 5 or so games with 5-10min in between q's. See if it makes any difference.

Although you will improve slightly from comp. Assume that any time spent playing comp is "fun" time and any time spent doing conscious practice is "work". You can devide up your play time from there however you see fit. Just don't try to DM 10h a day until you burn yourself out. The most I did back in my cs days was 3hours in a session and that was not typical. 


That's the answer you're looking for op, the effort needed to improve in a particular skill is always exponential
> I think most players hit their mechanical plateau in gold

what the fuck no

diamond, not gold

diamond is where everyone has no brain but a decent level of mechanical skill. after that you actually need to learn how to think about the game to get better

> Start tracking ults, who's alive on which team, and what your job in the next push is. What ults should your team commit to the next fight? Are you winning the fight or losing the fight? Focus more on the big picture rather than your inidividual mechanics.

this is good advice too, sure, but there's no reason to stop trying to improve your aim, particularly if you think it's a weakness of yours

Any way to FFA against friends on PS4?
Self explanatory. I have a few friends on PS4 I'd love to queue FFA against, just for a "who's better" type thing, wondering if there is any way outside of a custom match?All que at same time or custom are the only ways sadly
There's a good reason you can't queue for match-making ffa as a group - because it's so exploitable.

The mode is meant to be an everyone-for-themself affair, if you could go in as a group there'd be nothing to stop you playing as a team - not shooting each other and working together to shit all over the hapless randoms that made up the rest of the lobby. A group that did this would absolutely steamroll, it'd be completely unfair and ruin the game mode. It'd also be highly commonplace, due to a combo of a) people being dicks, b) you'd basically HAVE to do it yourselves to be able to compete.

If you want to play ffa with friends, use custom game, that's what it's there for.
What if you happen to be in different countries? Does queue at same time still apply?
It might due to low population but i have no idea 

How can I improve my aim with projectile-based heros?
I'm trying to get better at Zen/Pharah, but my aim always seems to be the problem. With Zen, one trick I learned to practice aim is shoot each orb individually. Try to predict where they're going to be and lead each shot. Try to hit every orb one at a time.
Try to predict where the enemy is going to be, especially with pharah.  Always try to shoot a little in front of where you think the enemy is going to be, depending on the angle your shooting from

What are the best and most in depth Genji guides out there?
I don't know what it is about this ninja cyborg but it feels like no matter how much i practice him i don't get better. Does anyone know of some quality Genji videos or write ups to help me learn? Preferribly by a pro or analyzing a pros gameplay. Thank you in advance for any help!Genji main here. I used to try to improve with pure guides. It doesn't work. 90% of the reason for my drastic improvement from being shite to carrying is because I practiced. Maybe 2 - 5% of it was guides. 

The only thing you need to know is with ulti. 

Normal ulti. 

If they're grouped up and your zarya can bubble you or you can get some other protection, dash into them, ult, dash into them again because the dash resets, and then slash. If they have a mercy, immediately dash to her after you get the second kill at least. 

If they're not grouped up, jump, dash into the air, jump again, then dash down to the nearest support, kill them, and continue. This should usually yield at least two kills. at least. 

Nanoblade: 

Slash, dash. Not much to say. Or dash slash. Usually if you know you're gonna get nanoed dash into the air, to make it easier for her. Make sure you can land a dash, otherwise everything falls apart. 

Those are the only tips you can get for Genji. If you want to dm me your gameplay and I'll try to find time to go over it during the weekends. 

Don't get disheartened if practice doesn't do everything. There comes a time for everyone where they suddenly click, and Genji feels so much easier. You'll have one good game, then have a few bad ones. You'll come back a week later and have another good game. You'll continue, until a month later you have a whole day of pure good games. Then the next day almost all your games are really bad. A couple days later you have 3 good games in a row. Then after a month or two of this your Genji goes click, and every game is good. It happens eventually. 
Become a Genji Pro:

Step 1) Get [almost] killed by your older brother. I mean, completely torn to shreds. 

Step 2) Get resurrected by hot German doctor who gives you a cybernetic body. She's gotta be like an angel though or this doesn't work.

Step 3) Train with robot monks in the mountains for some undetermined number of years. Meditating. Rebooting. Defragging. The whole sh'bang.

Step 4) Install hacks into your OS with auto tracking shurikan that are the size of your fist but fit in your wrist.

Step 5) Now you are a cyborg ninja capable of breaking the laws of physics but jumping off of mid air to complete the fabled double jump previously developed by the grand masters in the legendary Smash Bros arena.

After that there's nothing to it. Occasionally whip out your magic sword and whoop some non-cybernetic booty.

Seriously though...magic sword and robot hacks? I'm surprised he's not also part dragon....oh wait....
Watching some 10:00 clickbaited silver montages

/s
To add onto this, in the situation in which there is a mercy.
Dash into mercy + activate dragonblade,1 slash then dash to her guardian angel target, then slash again.

This is Zarya's season too – learn her!
Learn Zarya. Play Zarya. Barrier yourself and step into an enemy Junkrat's spam. ~~50~~ 40 charges. Barrier another frontline teammate (a barrier works with Rein's shield, by the way). Now ~~100~~ 80 charges. Melt anyone that gets close. Bomb anyone that's far away. Alternate the self/teammate barriers every 5 seconds to keep yourself topped off. Congratulations, you own a 48 foot radius around you, thanks to an auto-lock Junkrat.The maximum charge from a single bubble is 40.
>Alternate the self/teammate barriers every 5 seconds to keep yourself topped off

Debatable. This is good to do if you trust your teammates to not get themselves killed, or if you like to carry via DPS-Zarya.

Most advice I've seen recommends holding on to ally barrier for only 2 things: engaging and peeling.

**Engaging**

When your Rein wants to charge, when your Winston wants to dive in, when your DPS ally wants to ult ...you give them a barrier.

**Peeling**

You can essentially delete ally mistakes by saving ally barrier to peel for them. Ally gets pinned by Reinhardt? Ally gets caught in Junkrat trap? Ally gets flashbanged? Ally gets slept? Ally gets stuck with a Tracer bomb? Ally over-extends? 

---

That said, you can be proactive with barriers *in between* team fights (assuming you play at a rank high enough to group up at all before going into discrete team fights). But once the team is ready to fully engage, it's time to go back to saving your barriers for key moments.

And when your team has the momentum in a fight, you can be more liberal with using barrier to recharge your energy (keep the momentum). So for example, if you're in a 6v4 or even 5v4, you can probably start using barriers to recharge from 60 to 100 rather than playing cautiously. Playing aggressively is the best way to finish a team fight where you have an advantage.

---

>Bomb anyone that's far away.

You should also bomb people close to you in some cases.

* It can be a great way to finish off a low hp enemy.
* It's the most efficient way to utilize your weapon once it's under ~20 ammo.
* It's an ok way to tag (via splash damage) a mobile enemy that you can't quite track (like a Tracer).
Reload BEFORE ulting! 
If anyone wants to watch good zarya instructional vids, find the youtuber/redditor CANAS1AN and watch his vids. Got me from diamond to masters with a couple of bits of excellent advice. As someone that has Zarya as one of my very strongest heroes, I can't recommend his vids enough. I watched a fair few of her guides and his were the best :)

EDIT: Here's his first basic instructional vid and you can go from there to the advanced ones. Should note that this vid is old and she's been changed a little bit like her graviton, but I still think these vids are invaluable- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7SopaDZxFk&t=3s
This is Zarya's season?  Of course, what I'm about to say is all anecdotal, but I feel the need to say it after reading this post.

I alternate bubbles to make sure I always have one on cooldown, I prioritize bubbling tanks and healers first and foremost and I don't bubble for the sake of bubbling.  I try to get teams to flank shields with me when necessary and I never push in too far unless it's to build initial charge at the start of a match.  

I've watched VODs of coaches critiquing high rank Zarya play to see what I can improve and have been able to easily incorporate those suggestions into my gameplay, some of which I mentioned above.  Consistently through placements I was high energy and not getting wrecked.  I fully realize I'm an off tank.  I work well with a Rein or Roadhog, even Winston.

Season 5, I climbed by approximately 700 SR (solo queue as Lucio) and that felt fair, as well (won a slight bit more than I lost.)  I usually played about 7-10 matches a week.

Season 6, I went 8-2 in placements (solo queue as Zarya) and placed 56 SR above where I did last season.  In many matches my personal performance was pretty good, sometimes golds, sometimes silver, 35 elims and 5 deaths, things like that.  Staying alive, managing her toolset well, never a burden to the team.  

What felt the best, though, was how well the people I played with and I were working together.  I thought to myself "I'm surprised placements went that well, and that's a fair result, close to where I was last season."  People were communicating and working hard, playing as a cohesive unit for pretty much all of those matches and it felt great, win or lose.

Since then, I have dropped 265 SR in a very short span of time.  People, unlike placements, now don't listen to comms.  People don't group up.  People feed like mad and if you make suggestions, they don't even bother to flame or be toxic, they just don't listen or respond.

I can say I'm not a bad player until I'm blue in the face and I honestly don't have the unrealistic expectation that people should just believe me carte blanche.

That said, I guess what I'm trying to relay is, Zarya is a tank you really have to work with.  Help keep her alive so she has high energy.  Stick by her side, group up, communicate when your shield is low so she can bubble at the right time (just before it breaks) or before you charge/jump in.  Let her body block for you when appropriate.  In my games, that has stopped happening after placements and people just run off and do their own thing, expecting it to all work out...  "this time it'll be different!"  

The hero you pick is only as viable as the team is willing to make them, especially in Zarya's case.  She doesn't really have a get out of jail free card like other tanks or dps heroes.  She's slow moving, bubble doesn't last that long, she can't just jump out, or charge away or rocket off somewhere.  She can't wraith like Reaper, sprint like Soldier, dash like Genji or blink like Tracer.

She needs you just as much as you need her.  She's super viable with the right team.  This isn't Zarya's season.  It's just a season.
I don't enjoy playing zarya personally. Believe me I tried but I guess I can stay a support main.
And when it's Zarya hour, it's always great time to Zen!

And...

you know...

Sombra.
As someone who (almost) exclusively played Zarya from bronze to 3K, yes. Especially now that every team has a newborn Junkrat main.
I know, right? 

---
As soon as the Junkrat's buff was announced, that was my first thought. And just got the golden weapon, to boot. 

---
If you manage to land RMBs on enemy clusters, the Graviton Surge comes up really fast. The downside is that you don't get POTGs, as it goes to the one that rains down hell upon those caught in it.

*Edit: Typo*
You forgot to add after you use your bubble reaper comes out of nowhere and shreds you in one of his clips


> Alternate the self/teammate barriers every 5 seconds to keep yourself topped off.

Other people have touched on this but this is bad advice.

Use your barrier to farm charge, but at least during team fights you should be saving the projected barrier for teammates that are about to be killed. It nullifies so many things, can cause people to burn ults or major abilities and so on.

Also even with your barrier try to make sure you are actually taking damage first before using your barrier to make sure you get max charge from it. 
I have started playing a bit of zarya. It's funny how people lock junk rat without a clue as to what to do with him.

I be like shoot the fking Russian. And they comply .

Followed by something like 'wtf that damage' when I kill them rats. 
At least for the first month, until people realize this:

Season 5 = Dive Meta

Last buffs where to = RoadHog, Junkrat, Orisa, WidowMaker (I think I'm forgetting someone).

Hog and Rat have an specific job to do: countering the Dive

What counters Junkrat? An well made death ball with speed boost.

When have we saw an Death Ball defore? Oh yeah, since Season 1, when junkrat was trow down to garbage until now.


Buff isn't Op, people just never gave respect for the hero, he is just the new shine thing that everybody wants to complain about
What do you mean it work with rein shield . Does that mean that the dmg the barrier blocks wil get you energy too 
She is great against junkrat... Unless you bubble too early- then, its game on ;).
I prefer using her self-barrier to gain charge, and using the projected barrier to save teammates from mistakes.

The team damage will be MUCH lower if you just spam your shield onto the other tank to maintain high charge compared to letting your DPS die to things like Hooks, Sleeps, Traps, etc.   It's especially useful to save that Genji who is getting a lot of kills (but also getting a little too confident) as he burns his reflect and is still in the line of fire.   I barrier him and say "Genji come on back now pal, if not for this barrier you'd have died and this fight would be lost"
What do you mean it works with Rein's shield? You gain charge if someone is shooting his shield while he has your barrier on him?
Keep an eye out on bubbling against DF right clicks.  It appears to interact with your barriers similar to Rein charges at times.  Most of the time the DF will hit your barrier and all is good but other times he will zip through it and hit a teammate behind you or your bud.

Also, DF right click is 4 sec cooldown so you can only block 50% if you were devoting yourself to countering him.  With the prevalence of Hog/Rein you have some decisions to make on which abilities to block (but also should have little problems sustaining high energy).  

Good luck to new and returning Zarya players out there this season.  She's always been my favorite.  If you play with a core group of friends she's a good tank to pick up as you're in a great spot to combo off each other.
As someone who plays a lot of Orisa, if the enemy team has an Orisa, you will be max charge the whole game, it is unavoidable, just time your dives till after you see her orb and you'll be fine
Don't forget mercy can no longer rez entire teams so grav will be extremely powerful
I'll edit.
Holy crap, I didn't know that. I thought it would just suck up anything you throw at it.
Agreed. Spamming barriers whenever they are up is a terrible way to play Zarya, you'll waste most of them.
My RES has a little underscore after your tag, I don't know why, and I thought your comment was at -32.

The whole time I'm reading it, I'm thinking... well apparently this is bad advice, but I'm so bad it is useful to me... I don't care what anyone thinks I'm gonna keep this in mind!

I finally got to the end and had to look one more time at how you could be at -32 before I figured it out.
I'm always scared to bubble a teammate who has overextended. I don't want them to be rewarded for a bad idea and continue to do it, but I also don't want them to die and put us all at a disadvantage. You can ask people to not do things over chat, but people will always want to play the hero u.u 

I think a lot of the miscommunication here is with the phrase over-extend. I've been in way too many games where one person goes so far ahead, I too have to over-extend, putting me out of place as well. If someone's stepping out to get pics or on their way back, of course I'll bubble! It's just especially on defense, I don't want to risk two players out of place and most likely dying. On attack though, I totally see the benefit of bubbling someone who is over extending. Personally, I play Zarya on defense more often than attack so I'm in the mindset of defending a point during a fight right now.  *
This guy knows the struggle
To be fair, sometimes opportunities present itself and you don't have the time to reload. I guess the trick is to stop shooting if you expect a great opportunity soon (eg. the d.va is demeched but they're not grouped up enough). 

Also, you shouldn't always use bombs into your ult. If your team doesn't have enough damage (eg. your dps are dead) but you're high charge, you can use beam to kill 1 guy in the grav and then get another one after it ends.
+1 to CANAS1AN; highly recommended
I've watched a few of his vids before, as well.  I should pick those up again.
You say how much SR you gain or lose, but what tier are you in? The way people play in different tiers can be very different. You might need different tips based on what tier you're in
You said you watched coaches critiquing high level zarya play. Can I get a link? That'd be awesome to watch 
As a zarya/zen main I do not like the dreaded S word
if im charged up on kings row i will get ult under a minute
>implying teammates actually target your gravs
Agreed, if you're getting good team fights charge will come naturally and will almost be an afterthought.
Take care with the Smart Rats, you will find one in each hundred. But this one will know how to bait your bubbles and even kill you super fast.
if you bubble a rein, the middle of him will extend beyond his shield. if enemies hit that you get charge.

generally when rein gets a bubble, he should go for some swings(sometimes even charge) because he will still cover a lot and its a lot of pressure on the enemey team, even better if they have a rein because hes basically forced to block. usually this will give you 40 charge.
The bubble sticks out of the shield a little
Yes, exactly that unless they aim to the outside edges of reins shield.
[removed]
You should also know that it only has 200 health!
This ^ is very important to remember when playing zarya.When you are above 40 charge only ever use your projected barrier to save/aid a teammate, never to solely farm charge.
TIL im a terrible Zarya

Edit: according to masteroverwatch I average 160 blocked per bubble and I spam it a lot
Oh I never noticed that before. I see it too even without RES. It's apparently part of my flair if you inspect the HTML. I'm guessing I joined this subreddit at a time when it had more flairs (now I don't see any except for "educator", "youtuber", etc). So I probably chose a flair that is no longer properly supported.
Part of playing Zarya at lower ranks is to turn your team's mistakes into small advantages for you. That guy is not magically going to turn into a great player just because you spent one match *not* bubbling him when he made mistakes. View it like this instead: When he makes a mistake and you try to save his ass with the bubble, it's a win/win for your team: Either you save him and he stays in the fight, or he dies anyway but *you* become more dangerous. If you're scared to bubble him, your team doesn't get that benefit.
It's not your job to make your teammates better players, their mistakes are purely their own. If they aren't willing to look at their own playstyle critically there is nothing you can do that will make them do that.
i don't want to be rude but this isn't a good mindset to have. it's the red teams job to punish your teammates mistakes, it's your job to prevent them

worst case - your teammate misplays and dies before the team fight starts, but you've got some extra charge because you bubbled. more charge = more damage = quicker grav. your overextending teammate probably farmed some ult as well. if they were truly overextended you'll likely be close to another projected barrier by the time the red team can push the 5v6 anyway

the most puzzling thing though is that you said you don't want them to be "rewarded" for overextending. a reward to me is grabbing an early pick or farming ult, both of which can be huge for your team. maybe im thinking too big and the "reward" is your teammate getting out alive, but why would that ever be a bad thing?
I debated on whether I should mention my tier, but, I'm in bronze :)  Highest I ever obtained was 2223 in Season 2 (gold) but only played a handful of games because I was mortified of playing comp at the time.  Season 3 I dropped down a ton, Season 4 I didn't play at all.

Started Season 5 at 700-ish, climbed to 1400.  After placements in season 6 I was 1456.  Now I'm 1191 and the drop shows no signs of stopping.  

The way people play in bronze is... interesting is the best way to put it.  They seem to think strategy is not required.  That communication is not required.  

I think those are the biggest drawbacks to that tier.  I think I have no choice but to 3-stack to get out of this.  Solo queue isn't going to work.  The game itself and Zarya are both highly team reliant.
Sure :)

This is the VOD I watched.  Some things I already knew but some it helped me think outside the way I play:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TG4aFX2VoUA&t=929s
In my elo it's one In a thousand. But ya when there is a smart one I swap tank with someone and pick pharah or cree.

Junk rat ult is strong though at the moment. Previously I would always get the rip Tyre if I was cree or 76 now it's tougher.

Long live rats. 
As a Ren ,I wouldn't charge upon receiving a bubble unless it's a short distance charge. By the time the charge starts the bubble is already almost gone ...
Huh, TIL.

Just to be clear, are you talking only about Junkrat's AOE shots or does this work if Solider is shooting Rein's shield?
Don't be mean. This wasn't a collection of tips, it was a reminder that Zarya counters Junkrat.
Yeah, I've seen people mention that just because Zarya has her shield up, doesn't mean you can't still focus her down. 
It can absorb 200 dmg over time or absorb and Infinite amount before it's destroyed but also destroying it. Like D.va bomb or junkrat tire. 
Trading extra top-off charge for a teammate's life later when he *needs* a bubble is a one-sided deal. 
There's damage and there's damage, though. 

* If you bubble yourself and run out into crossfire, you're "preventing" damage that you wouldn't have taken *anyway*. 

* A dancing Lucio is a lot easier to hit when he has a giant bubble. There are a lot of situations where people are shooting at him and he's not in real danger, but if you put a bubble on him, it absorbs a lot of damage. 

* If DVa is being tickled by Winston and has Orb of Harmony, preventing that damage probably doesn't matter. When Orisa's at full health with Fortify, she doesn't need you to save her from some piddling damage. Tanks kind of exist to take damage. If you can help them do their job better it's one thing, but if they didn't need the help, that's someone else's life you could have saved. 

Of course if you're in a poking sort of situation, and you judge that nobody's going to be in real danger for the next 8-10 seconds, then sure: get some energy however you can. 
It can work if you're games are just constant clusterfucks. 
I meant in the case that they've way over-extended to the point where I also have to over-extend in order to bubble them. I don't think that's worth it, especially on defense. If they've gone a bit forward to get a pick, sure I'll bubble them. But I'm not about to risk the team both a damage and tank player if someone's getting a little too cocky. 
Yeah honestly bronze was really bad in s5 (my first season in this game) but this season, at least more people are on voice coms. My problem that is probably holding me back is solo queueing too much which is not a good idea in bronze. If you want to duo or something, just pm (not sure if i can post info here)
i could see her being hard to play in bronze if youre not getting great heals, but if you manage your bubbles well shes very survivable. Just make sure you have cover to dip behind if you personal bubble isnt utilized. I will also say that it seems like you are wanting to rely on your team keeping you alive rather than working on getting better positioning/ ability usage. You can blame your team for not playing well and helping you out which is true sometimes definitely, but its just as likely there are many things you can fix yourself.
U a real one

The only hero where I can kill an Rip Tire is Junkrat, I just trow an mine at it and is 100% success rate.

But on others I'm at 0%
yes long charges are bad anyways but if you cordniate with zarya it can work out
both, any damage that hits more or less the middle of his shield gives zarya charge while bubble is on him.
She doesn't really counter him, she is buffed when he's on the enemy team. 
He wasn't that mean and he's right; this is a fairly low quality post.
you get punished very hard for not securing the kill tho
I love getting a BS stat like 10k damage blocked because i eat the same dva bomb twice with both my bubbles
No, that's not how it works. A Zarya shield has 200hp and it disappears after 2s.
I don't play junk rat at all so I don't know lol. Thanks for the tip. 
That's is pretty much all countering really is.....
Even so.
> This is a fairly low quality post

You mean your post?
His comment attempts to turn the conversation from the content of the original post to how he's better and more knowledgeable than OP. It's condescending, judgmental, and contributes nothing to the conversation.
I think you have a point.  A call to play a character followed by inaccurate representations of their basic mechanics isn't really something we need to coddle.
I envision that like the scene from the first Avengers movie where Thor zaps Iron Man and powers him to like 300%.
But it will take infinite damage, if that damage happens instantly, like with a Junkrat tire or D.Va self-destruct.
He's right.  Zaryas shield can block an infinite amount of damage in a burst as long as it has 1hp remaining.  Dva bombs,  junk tires,  rein charges,  etc. They all do 0 damage to zarya herself but destroy the shield
> Alternate the self/teammate barriers every 5 seconds to keep yourself topped off. Congratulations,

Countering is being able to turn an enemy's advantage into a disadvantage. A Widow counters Pharah Mercy because now they can't float in the sky and a head shot completely eliminates the advantage of Mercy healing. This advantage either lets you kill the enemy team or lets you take away their advantage.

When it comes to Zarya, she gains DPS from the Junkrat spam, so Junkrat can't spam, but in this case, he actually can just spam because the spam doesn't ensure that he dies. In fact, his new movement ability ensures that he can get out of her range. It also lets him kill her faster than she can kill him (at full charge) in the right circumstances. So she doesn't counter him. She "soft counters" him. 
Nah countering is when you can either reliably kill them, or you can reduce their effectiveness by making them need to chance their playstyle.
No it isn't lol. A good Junk shreds Zarya now, two mines.
Always remember that you're not allowed to be decent to people on the internet! 
Oh my bad, misread it. Yeah there is no overflow damage (like all other shields), if it has even 1hp it can block large amounts of instant damage
Thank you for that clear explanation of both scenarios. I understand now :)
And Junkrat needs to change up his playstyle or he feeds the Zarya charge for days.....
Thankfully it has already been explained very clearly and constructively so no need for more explanation
Internet rule number 1: always be an asshole.
Literally every shield in the game works like this - if an instance of damage destroys the shield, all the damage is absorbed (i.e. No shields in the game have overflow damage hit those behind the shield when the damage is from one source)
And charge by itself doesn't counter anybody.
SCREW YOU, BUDDY






^I've ^been ^practicing! 
Then why can deadeye kill you through a rein shield if it breaks the shield?
charge makes Zarya a force to be reckoned with. Ask any junk main if they change things up if they see a zarya if you don't believe me. 
No, but it makes things worse for your team. Even if Junkrat's extra mobility can get _him_ out of range, a high-charge Zarya melting his tanks and healers faster is gonna be a problem. Junkrat does best when he can take advantage of his teammates occupying enemy attention. They can't do that if they're dead/running away for health.
Because deadeye is not one instance of damage. If several enemies are hiding behind a rein shield that's low enough, some of you will get shot. 
If there are 3 people in the eyesight of a deadeye.. McCree will shoot 3x. 1 or 2 (I'm not sure) Will break the rein shield, then the 3rd will still get the 3rd target. 
Deadeye is multiple instances of damage (one instance per bullet), so if there are bullets left after the shield is broken, you can still die behind the shield

PC aiming issue -- getting too "into" it
I've noticed lately that at the beginning of a match I'm pretty calm and can track decently well with Soldier, for example. However, once the combat starts to get intense, and everything is frantic, I find myself tensing up. Both my arms get pretty tense, and my aiming becomes very jittery as a result. Any advice on how to avoid this?The only way to stop is to break the habbit.

My advice? Set a phone alarm every minute eventually this alarm will end up in the thick of it.
Detense when it goes off.

Itll be anoiying but it will break the habbit.
That tension is built out of the excitement and stress of the moment. You're letting yourself be overcome by those emotions and such. You need to stay calm and collected. Keep your mind in control of your actions in those situations. Overtime it will become second nature and you can let your mind worry about other things while your muscle memory takes control of your actions.

Like, /u/Roadhogsback stated, a good tip to follow is to have an alarm set to go off every so often. Maybe every minute, maybe every 30 seconds or 15 seconds. People who use this technique vary in their time frame regardless of how long they set the alarm, it's intention is to snap you out of that extreme focus and tension and force you to remember to stay calm. Pulling yourself out of the moment lets you remember the things you need to be doing.

You can use this technique for more than just relieving the stress and tension but to also help train yourself to be more aware. When the alarm sounds you can check your surroundings or kill feed or whatever area you need to improve on. 

Some people, instead of an alarm, have kind of trained themselves to snap their wrist with a rubber band (the band worn around the wrist of course). It can take a bit of training to remember to do it but the idea is to train your mind to be able to break away from the task at hand and put a little bit of processing to something outside of the immediate concern (like a team fight). This helps build awareness as well simply because it's taking your mind away from that tense focus and allows you to notice and recognize other things happening you wouldn't have before due to tunneling. 
I had this problem. I realized it's because I was so invested in trying to win when I played comp that I couldn't focus on the things I needed to improve on. So I tried very hard to pretend I was just in quick play and not worry about whether I was winning or losing as long as I was working on my aim. I stopped worrying about team comp and muted voice comms. If there were enemies in front of me I just made sure to put my crosshair over them before I shot and stayed calm so I could focus, and if I died it wasn't a big deal. I dropped a ton of SR but my aim improved very quickly and is now good even when I autopilot. Getting back the SR was pretty easy from there.

I forgot to add one thing. I didn't even realize that my aim got better until someone asked if I was a smurf because my aim is too good for bronze. At that point I was like wait actually yeah my aim is too good for bronze why am I here?
Take deep breaths too, it centers your mind and body. It's a difficult thing for me to remember to do even at work or anywhere
I honestly had this issue too and it was immediately alleviated by reducing my sensitivity. Which REALLY helped my aim too. I run 3.5 sens with 1000dpi
I use to have his problem and what i did was i started making mental note of when it was happening. Whenever it did I'd tell my self to calm down and relax. After a while it just became habit like and whenever I'm tense i notice it.
I take the anti-anxiety supplement herb called Ashwagandha. "Sensoril" type, 240 mg 30 mins before the game. Works like a charm for me.
Very thorough response, thank you! That alarm idea sounds interesting, I'll have to give it a go. 

Does Sombra not work in Mid-Gold?
I have an alt account in Mid-Gold that I dedicate to Sombra (I'm a high plat/diamond level Ana + Mercy player, but absolutely love Sombra). However, I find that she isn't a very good pick at this elo because my team doesn't know how to play with her. They won't use/play around health packs, so it's more of a self-heal and health pack denial thing. Follow ups on EMPs are iffy and don't work out as well (either they get picked so it's a 5v6, they won't target the key targets/same targets, they don't know how to act on EMPs unless paired with a Zarya ult, etc). Originally, I had the idea that I could climb myself out if I got good enough and it would make me an even better Sombra than normal in Plat, but I'm getting discouraged. Especially when I switched to a Tracer or Reaper on those games where Sombra's utility is being completely ignored, and I find myself going from Bronze (or silver) damage to heroes to Gold. I know that doesn't mean much, but it kind of speaks to me in terms of how much more of an impact solo-artist heroes do, especially when I'm able to take out the supports much more easily. I just enjoy Sombra more, especially her ability to team wipe more (love me those juicy 2CP maps for this). Do you think I should bare it out and keep with Sombra until I can climb out of that elo, or just use Mercy + Ana to get me to mid-plat ish range and continue with Sombra from there?I played Sombra on my alt account and climbed out of gold. The key is to not use EMP as an engagement tool. Use it when the two teams are already engaged and fighting.

Hacking important health packs and denying them to the enemy is already a good enough use. Don't expect your team to play around them, they won't even do that in diamond. But it's not that big of a deal if the healthpacks are already ones they want to use anyway.
Sombra is one of my mains and I recently used her to level up my wife's account. Just to see again the difference between low gold vs diamond. It was not to difficult strategy wise, but toxic wise is another story in EU.

- health packs. Don't expect your team to use it. Even in higher diamond people don't use them as often as you expect them to. This means you can use them yourself and more importantly: deny them to enemies. Go and hack one or two very offensive.

- EMP. Never use it to engage. Even if you shotcall and announce it. Majority won't be able to go in and capitalize from it. Until people start you already lost 3-4 seconds of it. Solution: use it during a fight that already started!

- hacking is the most difficult part for me. I usually try to hack tanks first and announce it. If that does not work i start to hack their healers and take them down. 

- translocator: its your get out of jail card. But it also is your 4 second blink to any fucking direction spell during a fight! You need to have the timings and its pattern memorized and you can throw it around like nothing. No need to look at where it goes. You know the trajectory by hearth. No need to look at the CDs you must know them. If you achieve that Sombra becomes a whole new beast.

Overall the most difficult part for me is the toxicity towards Sombra. So many people throw the moment they see Sombra or will always blame you - yet fail to acknowledge that maybe they might also be part of the problem.
She does but I wouldn't recommend it. Trust me, I've tried.
I'm in mid-gold and I went on an awesome tear as Orisa paired with Sombra.  Sombra would announce she was hacking the Rein or D.Va... and I would just blow them to pieces.
 I love sombra too. I dedicated 50 QP hours to her before testing the waters in comp. I agree with one of the top comments. It took me a long time to realize but people will not follow up on even the best initiating EMPs in gold (without grav). Do it just after one of your other team mates initiated the fight. If I see my team starting to commit ults to the fight, I drop that sweet sweet EMP like it's hot. They usually start to see the advantage of it and follow up better for the rest of the match. People in gold like an easy scapegoat to flame and Sombra is at the top of the list. I try to play her on maps that I feel the most confident with her (All 2CP, university oasis, ruins/lighthouse illios, control center lijang tower, Hollywood, Route 66 to name a few) I also try really hard to let my team know I'm trying my best by communicating hacks and politely asking tanks to use my hacked Megas when they are close to the fight. Hope you continue to get better! I'm sure you knew a lot of this but I've had the best results these strats :)  
She does not... unless you 3+ stack w people who have good gamesense.

Orrrrrr if you ask pregame if people count Sombra as a second healer, if they majority say no, bad plan, if they all say yes, you're probably good to go
I did the same thing as you and in the same SR brackets. My alt account I went sombra and realized the same thing. People don't react to her emp however many times I advertise it before using it. She's fun to play but not a good pick at all at this level.  Not sure what level works for her to be honest. 
The best tip I can give as a high Diamond Sombra main is to wait until your team ults to EMP to get the best effect without much effort from your team. Try to stay in the back line once you get ult.
You may be playing sombra more like a support at that rank but maybe switching your play style to hack the enemy and try to be in the enemy teams back line more rather than hacking health packs may benefit you. Try playing sombra almost like a tracer but very opportunistic at this elo
A lot of heroes that Sombra hard-counters are very popular in Gold - namely D.Va and Genji.   Just keep them hacked as much as humanly possible (even burning EMP to do so) and it'll be tough for your team to lose the fight.
Use her for more than just her EMP. Sombra can actually frag out if you have good tracking
Hi there. I climbed from Gold to Masters with Sombra. I'll be honest...I don't think I knew how to play her well until about 30 hours in and didn't feel like I had truly gotten a full grasp until about 100 hours in. She takes a lot of time to master.

That being said, you can absolutely team carry with her. In lower ranks, it's more about DPS rather than supporting, which changes a bit as you go higher up in rank. The biggest things you can do in Gold is get picks on supports and disable tanks. Zen and DVa should be easy kills and ult charge for you. Practice performing loops(using translocator to bail you out back to a hacked pack) to get picks, and then as you get more comfortable you can start holding onto your translocator and using it more for positioning.

If you want to play Sombra at higher ranks I would absolutely encourage you to keep playing her until you climb naturally rather than playing other heroes and then trying to switch. Mercy and Ana have zero skills that will translate into good Sombra play, so I would avoid that mindset.
Sombra is my most played hero (almost 90 hours), but I too noticed that nobody knows how to play with a Sombra on your team in Silver and Gold. I couldn't climb with her at all last season, and this season I switched to Mei after two games. I'm not sure what it's like in Platinum or Diamond, but I hear it doesn't get better for Sombra players.


&nbsp;

Ironically, 62 games later and 430 SR higher, playing Mei seems to have made me more competent at playing Sombra, so I'm thinking about trying it again.

&nbsp;

What I've noticed with Sombra is that your own team flees if you use EMP to engage the enemy team. I don't know why, but apparently it's very scary for them to follow up on. I used to hack people a lot, but that's not necessary at all. In fact, it's better to use it like Mei's primary fire. Eliminate people first, but if a target is too big or bothersome to take out on your own, hack/ freeze them so they can't get away or recover. Learning the exact timing to hack a Mercy is very important too. Hack her too early and she gets her rez off, hack her too late and she'll already have gotten her rez off.

&nbsp;

In the end I rarely hack anybody, using my EMP instead in teamfights while everyone is already engaged, or to quickly hack this Roadhog, Pharah, Mercy or Tracer so my team can help me take them out.

&nbsp;

Don't go on mad flanks, but stay close to the point/ payload. Preferably on it. Stay with your supports and tanks. If someone gets close, eliminate or hack them in that order. Hacking someone through a friendly Rein shield is great, although I usually spend my hacks on making sure the closest health packs stay hacked 24/7. Don't leave your translocator on a healthpack unless it's literally next to the point. Don't translocate out of a teamfight when you're on low health. Your team needs you right there, rely on your supports to keep you alive. You'll need your translocator to chase that Mercy down or to dodge that dVa/ Tracer/ Doomfist ult with your invincibility frames. Try your hardest to get those gold objective time and objective kills medals.
If you're a diamond level Ana player you should be able to shit on people in gold, with Sombra offensive capabilities alone.
You need to consistently identify opponents that are out of position and kill them reliably by yourself, otherwise, there is just no point in playing Sombra at diamond or below.
Paradoxically, I found Sombra to work quite well in lower ranks. The reason being is currently in gold, people don't seem to want to run 2 healers. Sometimes it's even poor Zenyatta solo healing. As a result, your health packs are excellent for providing sustain for your team and denying it for the enemy team. Same reason why Sombra is pretty good in qp, she just becomes the healer :') 
Oh god no
It's that he team will not be able to work with you.
I tried this once and every time I emp I'd just see the team there staining at all the hacked enemy's wondering when they will die
in lower ranks sombra needs to gets picks on her own otherwise its not that great because they wont take advantage of healthpacks or hacked targets
I had an alt that we threw games to get into bronze. (6stack of throwers don't worry. )

Currently the account is in platinum from sombra, Genji, and doomfist only. I believe it currently has a winrate of 91% on sombra. 

So I can confirm that you can climb out of gold with sombra. 
You need to improve your Sombra play instead of blaming your team.  You can't just hack health packs, throw out EMPs, and expect your team to carry you.  You have to frag, combo your ult, and hack important targets (Mercy w/ ult, main tanks) during fights.  The Sombra that spends the entire game running errands away from the team isn't very useful.
If it makes you feel any better I try to use Sombra health packs.  I'm in mid-gold.
Sombra can work in gold but you need a really good understanding of how you team thinks, faster than they do
Usually not. Whenever I play her nobody ever uses my health packs/does anything off my hacks and emps even if I call them out
Always blame the team. It could just be that you're not good enough to climb out of gold as a DPS either.
Well, you figured out by yourself...

Each elo have his own meta heroes. You can climb with anyone, of course. But if you pick the good ones you will probably spend at lease 75% less time.

Examples:

1. I was an Lúcio player that never got out of Silver, then I played Zeny, in 2 weeks I jumped to Diamond and on Diamond my Lúcio was so much more useful!

2. I have a friend that plays since the open beta, he is an Main One Trick Torbjörn since day 1, never played any other hero on comp! Be it on attack, defense or control, he is always the torb! He is a MONSTER! He just his all those shots with his gun, he kills winstons, tracers, genjis, pharahs, doomfists... But he plays torb on attack, and even being good, this means that he will have an freaking hard time. What this makes to him? Well he only got diamond NOW and I'm ensure you he can stand GM with his torb skills, but torb will never be good to atk an 2cp... (this without counting with the haters)
From experience, (gold here) Sombra isn't the ideal pick. As with Ana, she is both hard to play and hard to play with. 

---
Even yesterday, I told our Sombra she's a support and should consider building ult and use her EMP when I graviton, and not before.

Needless to say, he lashed out and said Sombra is a dps, and continued wasting his ults and dying in the enemy's backline.

---
I've started S6 as Ana, and I facepalmed myself so many times, because people do not know how to use the nano to benefit their own dps. 

---
I personally would recommend picking up Pharah, as Golds are terrible at handling flying units. A trio of Zarya-Mercy-Pharah combo is very hard to counter.
"Alt account in mid gold"
Lol
Oh, I'm going to try that now. I usually start the fight with EMPs, unless we have a Zarya.
Agree with this! At this level it is much more effective to hack healthpacks to deny them from the enemy than to support your own team
Sadly, I agree even at diamond people don't use or play around hacked health packs
To add onto this, Sombra is *not* a flanker but a DPS support. Try to have an ally nearby to bail you out of trouble when needed. If you cannot get out of gold, I can guarantee you your deaths are in the bottom 25%
> most difficult part for me is the toxicity towards Sombra. So many people throw the moment they see Sombra or will always blame you - yet fail to acknowledg

Yup...I've encountered them. But it hurts them more than me to be honest, because it's my alt account for practicing and not for climbing (my main is for that).

Thanks for some of the tips. I think I'll start EMPing after fights break out. I've been using it to initiate fights, but now I realize that this might not be the best idea anymore.

Secretly sad that D.Va is getting reworked/nerfed because she's so amazing to verse as Sombra. Not only can you demech her in oneclip (lots of ult charge), but then you can translocate after doing that and get your health back up for more ult charge. It's so nice.

I really enjoy her though and am not entirely sure what to do with this 2nd account that I wanted to dedicate to her because I feel like it's hit or miss if she does well in that elo (more often miss). I don't think I'm good enough to hard carry people neither, and I feel bad when I think I'm not contributing and ultimately making people who are trying to climb lose SR (even though I'm enjoying myself playing Sombra in comp and don't care too much about my SR rating).
Yeah, I've noticed that. I played Tracer a few times and just thought to myself how much easier games were AND how much less toxic people were towards you. Every game is my fault up until the point we win, no matter what happens. It's so silly and adds to the annoyance factor of playing her, despite how much fun she is (to me). 
Sorry, but I main Sombra and eat Genjus and D.vas for breakfast - imho heronly counters are Junkrat or a better Sombra.

Both are hacked as soon as they pop their def abilty and soon after that they are respawning.
I'm like borderline high plat to diamond. Maybe I should be able to, but I'm not. I guess that I should stick with it and keep playing to improve, but sometimes I get so discouraged T_T because I feel sort of useless. Maybe it's also the drilling into my head with people constantly yelling at me for picking Sombra.
I actually think that Gold is pretty good with getting 1-2 healers. I never seen a Zen solo healing yet.  In fact, some people tilt when you don't get 2-2-2, despite winning.
Yeah, I think I'll just stick with it. Maybe I need to improve my mechanics and game sense with her, which will make me even better than the average Sombra in Plat (once I hit it). I've just been very discouraged I think because of how difficult it has been lately (and teammates adding fuel to the fire with their nasty comments all the time). Part of me wants to just play my support mains this weekend and get my account to mid-plat and see if it works out any better. That way, if I fall, I know that it's all because of me. Especially since when I switch to Tracer, I instantly do a lot of work (or reaper for just peeling the problematic Winstons off my backline) and think to myself that I could probably get to Plat no problem (~a weeks time if I have free time) just playing Tracer. Problem is I love Sombra too much and don't want to do that.
Yeah, I'm going to take more advice that people gave me and see if it works out better. 
It could be. I try not to blame the team because I managed to climb super fast by always looking at myself (low 1400s => mid 2900s in 1 season). You could be right though. I could just be a trash DPS. I only really enjoy Tracer and Sombra. Although I do work with Tracer, especially on koth maps, at this elo, I definately remember games where I felt like dead weight.
Attack Torb on 2CP is good for a very specific purpose, which is stopping stall, the turret is so much faster at engaging and cleaning up stall trickle than most people are, however Torb isn't as good as most other picks at getting to that game state.
Technically, she is in the offensive category. Though most see her as a pseudo-support.

If I was on your team, I would EMP before you launch your Grav. But I'll still give a count down to when I deploy. This is largely due to the buff Zarya has with her Grav that nullifies any escape abilities any enemy unlucky enough to enter it's event horizon. An exception I would make is if Lucio is in your target and has Drop the Beat ready since I can go in after he gets stuck in the event horizon and uses his ult. I come in and EMP his temp shields away. Prior to her Buff, I would EMP at the same time you used your Grav.

Most of the time, you'll see me targeting their tanks and healers and will telelocate out when things get hairy (I suspect this Sombra player you encountered does not use her telelocator wisely).

The Sombra player you've encountered just makes me want to shake my head for giving Sombra mains a bad name.

I actually find Ana to be fairly strong in Gold. When I played Ana on this account, I just destroyed stuff. It's easier to protect yourself compared to Mercy (sleep/kill people who are after me) and Anti-heal people who are half or below (to secure kills easier, before Mercy can heal them up).
Did your post accomplish anything towards answering my question? Did it make you look like a helpful person (or the opposite)? Maybe you should read the entire post and try putting your input, if you are actually in a position to do so, instead of polluting this sub with (more) toxic comments. Thank you.
I'm almost plat and have risen through gold with sombra. Her ult is definitely a button to make your team run back towards your spawn for 6 seconds. Even if everyone is together and I count it down. I've also been getting hate more when we win then lose now it's weird. "Sombra why'd you solo ult?" "I got the mercy flying in for the rez and won us the game..."
Fitzy did a silver-GM series, so sombra should work in all levels.
Uhh, I'm not sure I agree with this. Sombra can play as a flanker and can easily harass an enemy's backline repeatedly and consistently. She also wants to push forward to hack enemy healthpacks.

And if Sombra is in trouble she doesn't need an ally to bail her out, she can translocate out of danger. She should never find herself in a situation where her translocator won't save her.
I'm bummed because she'll be less of a Zarya chewtoy, though I suppose the missiles could be good shield-bait.
I can't disagree with that!
Well, you could duo w me and get me out of silver. I know how to play w Sombra (diamond console, just suck at PC), I play tank and healer, so I could tank only routes where packs are hacked.

Or just duo+ w people that would like to climb, and tell them you will only be playing Sombra, and to learn how to play w her as a healer
Playing Sombra on my alt at 2700 works great, 60% winrate so far this season.  Playing on my main that placed in Gold, lose lose lose lose lose.  I don't get it.
I main her too and even get shit from the blues if we win, the struggle is real.
Reread my post.  I said that sombra counters those two. 
It's fine OP. Original commenter isn't necessarily right. A master level support player doesn't mean that they're a master level DPS player too and Sombra isn't known for dealing a massive amount of damage. Additionally the difference between plat and gold isn't huge so it shouldn't be expected for you to carry and shit on people. 
You can always test this. I know sombra is very team coordination reliant (I don't play her myself), but maybe try playing a few games with voice chat/text chat off and just see if you feel you're playing better relying on just reading your team's movements. At gold level, team coordination is probably a pretty iffy thing anyways, even if everyone's in voice chat. Up to you whether you want to do this, but it might be worth a try if you're really dealing with that much hate playing her. Had to do this myself, and I've been doing much better now that I'm not listening to the chronic hate in voice chat (I'm silver rank and play a lot of off meta heroes).

Edit: Just FYI, as a Junkrat player, I absolutely love when there's a sombra on my team. I usually stake out one of their heath packs and farm it, since healers at my level rarely like to heal Junkrats. (I've literally had my healers tell me I wouldn't be getting heals because I was playing JR. It sucked.)
You're lucky! I play in masters and gm where we frequently get 2 healers, and when I was being a backseat gamer for when my brother visited me, I was really shocked at how often he would be forced to play Zenyatta all by himself. He would then get flamed obviously because people are lovely. He plays in gold/plat. Possibly related to the time we play Overwatch and some other factors. But if you consistently get balanced comps, great! That's half the battle.. 
Maybe with a duo queue, it works. 
But soloQ is a nightmare, as players aren't all confident in playing their hero of choice. 

---
Duo queue has been fruitful lately; Zarya/Zen and Zarya/Orisa. Just need the dps to be able to shoot a vehicle-size target when I grav them.
I used to do that in S5. But now I find it infuriating when Rein doesn't charge that sleeping target, or when a dps decides to wake up a Raging Winston.

With Zarya, it's fool-proof, as I can also do massive damage. It's literally shoot the big pile of enemies. Can't miss.
Well ofc fitzy can climb out of gold on sombra 
The thing though is that Fitzy is an insanely good Sombra. He can hard carry that elo because he has top 500 status mechanics, game sense, etc. Most people don't. I especially do not. He could carry Gold games playing whatever because of all that. I don't take him as a good  marker for what can and can't be done. Yes, he shows that it is possible. But what I am saying is that, I feel useless and at times very bad for picking Sombra because of it (mostly because people don't capitalize on stuff I'm doing and I guess I play her more for utility than DPS, since I am a support main). However, when I switch to Tracer, I feel like I'm doing work and think that I could get to Plat with not much of an issue if I stick with her...but I want to do Sombra. This paired with the insane hate I get for picking Sombra just has put me in a very discouraged mindset.
That's not really a good comparison. Few of us are at his level. Just because one person can do it doesn't mean everyone else can. 
I agree with harassing but she doesn't execute flanking on the level of say Reaper, Tracer, and Genji. 
you sir, I challenge you to a duel! *slaps with glove*
This is my experience too. I've played her a couple times in 2900s and felt like I was doing great, granted it wasn't enough of a sample size (can only remember 3 games as her tbh). However, when I strictly play her in Gold, I feel like I can't have as much of an impact as I want. Maybe it's because I rely more on her utility to bring for the team, but I feel like my Tracer does decent work...who knows.

Debating boosting my account up to mid-high plat this weekend by playing my mains and seeing how I fair. If I fall, I fall..and then I'll know for sure that it is my fault.
Well they had to "carry" you (even if they were all on your back)...
ohhhhh, the other way around - now i see :D
People always wake up sleeping targets, no matter the Elo. Yes, it happens less...but people are human and mistakes happen. It doesn't magically stop because you hit x rank. Get that out of your head.

Also, sometimes Reins charging in is not the best idea. I've had nano'ed Reins die before because they took it as "go full ham". If someone plays Rein often enough, they'll probably know (better than you if you don't)  the limitations. Trust them. Use Nano more reactively in this elo. Roadhog began ulting? Use your ult. Your Genji not have ult but is deep in the enemy team doing work? Use your ult (it actually helps him charge his ult quicker too, not die AND do more damage). etc. 

I think you can literally carry yourself out of Gold just by having good positioning and decent aim as Ana. I find that people have trouble getting to me and when they do, I'm usually near a health pack so they can't kill me quickly (nade+health pack+sleep dart). This makes them waste a lot of time and resources and get discouraged at trying to kill me as the match progresses (in gold) after a couple unsuccessful attempts.
Hide chat and don't join voice chat. It did wonders for my winrate. I always read back what people type in the chat after a game, and it gradually got less and less toxic as my winrate increased and stabilised at around 65%. The past 10 games they didn't even ask me to switch anymore.
it means if ur good enough you can climb, doesnt matter what league you are. Theres no such thing as x character is specifically bad in this league
Yeah I'm thinking I'm going to stick with Tracer and Pharah to get my main back up to plat at least.  Sombra seems too reliant on other DPS and coordination to work well at lower tiers.
You're are correct. However, the lower you go, the harder it is to integrate certain characters. Sombra requires an immense amount of teamwork to reach her full potential, and at Gold and below that is incredibly difficult to do. 
I think people really overstate the amount of teamwork that is required to play well with Sombra. I guess people assume they must engage with EMP, and they do the countdown before a fight and no one follows up.

Fitzy does this on his stream a lot, and even in GM, he will do it too soon and his team can't capitalize even if they wanted to. Especially for lower SR players, *just wait*! If you see your team actively engaging into a fight, *then* EMP. It requires no insane coordination.

This way still works and you'll actually get the full 6 seconds of hack time to be meaningful. Half of it won't be wasted as your team gets their shit together.

As for teams playing around hacked healthpacks, it's just not that important. As long as Sombra is hacking important healthpacks that deny the enemy team them and leave them ready in the off chance your team needs them, that's good enough.

This is why Sombra is mediocre on first point Numbani. None of the healthpacks are in a position to really be used naturally by your team during the fight. But first point Volskaya is amazing because the healthpacks are basically right on the point. They are going to be used no matter what.

The hardest part about ranking up with Sombra at a lower SR is her mechanics. Being able to have consistently good tracking and diving around the enemy team with her translocator and stealth will be a more limiting factor than having your team play around you as Sombra.


I can't aim under pressure, how do I fix that?
A deathmatch FFA game just brought that point home painfully. I can't hit anything when I'm being shot at/attacked in any way in this game. I've died many times because of this and it made me tilt a lot in the past, which made my aim even worse.

When I have a clear line of sight and a second to aim, I can headshot left right and center, but as soon as I get focused I'm dead. I'm just dead, because I can't hit anything anymore. My arm tenses up, I flail all over the place and that's it for me. Doesn't matter if it's a Pharah shooting at me, a Junkrat flying towards me or a Genji throwing ninja stars, my arm suddenly gets the dexterity of a piece of rebar and I'm dead seconds after.

Does anyone have tips to solve this issue?Repetition.  If you're panicking under pressure you're going to have to get more comfortable being under fire.  
Do some more death match and dont worry about dying. Don't stress about getting hit and just focus on getting a shot or two off before you die.  Get more comfortable with being in those tight quarters fights and get practiced on taking those shots. Don't rush the shots.  The military mantra of slow is smooth and smooth is fast applies for taking shots in overwatch. 
Practice and accept that you will get hit and you will die. Once you aren't stressed about getting killed you can work on developing the repetitive skills to deal with those fights. 
You need to develop close quarters skills until they are reflexive so you can fall back on your skills rather then trying to 'rise to the occasion'. 
I found playing with a low sensitivity helped me to not get so tense. Or that it has less effect on performance, since small variations affect it less.
Don't pressure yourself. If you are up against a soldier or mcree just try to adad strafe so they can't hit you but don't think too hard on that. Just do it unconsciously. If up against a pharah or junk, try to avoid her rocket or pills and keep shooting. 
I don't know what heroes you typically play, but I have a bit of this problem as well. I'm a Junkrat player, so it's not really my aim per say, but I panic when things get too close to me, and start making really stupid mistakes. I've recently been playing deathmatch with my concussion mine disabled (unbound the button), meaning I can't escape or run away (or panic-hurl it toward the enemy and hope it hits). My concussion mine is basically my oh-shit button. Without it I'm stuck on the ground, stationary, can't escape from danger and I die a lot. But it's helped me stop panicking in those situations, because it made me accept that my death was pretty much inevitable. My only goal was to hit the enemy (not even kill them, just hit them) before I die. It's done wonders for my in-game performance. 

If you've got abilities or habits that your relying on for those oh-shit moments when something rushes you, try disabling them. Try deliberately putting yourself into the situations you don't like. Also try getting the jump on the enemy first at close range. If you see them from a distance, instead of taking the shot you normally would at longer range, push in on them and initial the close range fight yourself, on your terms. It should give you some practice at close range fighting, while also making it so you feel more in control of the situation.

Hope that helps, and good luck!
Another thing I found: Fighting a Genji almost always tilts me instantly, because I can't hit him for the life of me. His constant jumping and dashing around is so irritating, I get a kill on him in maybe 5-10% of the fights I have with him when I'm playing anything hitscan. (The Genji player then calling me a noob, spamming "Aho ga?" which means "Are you an idiot?" in English and taunting me doesn't really help either)
This is probably what's actually going to help me. The best shots I get when I'm not worried I'll die if I don't hit.
I'm fairly comfortable with my sensitivity, I'm at 950 dpi and 3.85 ingame sensitivity. I don't think it's a hardware or software related problem at all, it's my brain screwing me over.
Thing is, Junkrat now has 2 concussion mines so he uses one to blast himself towards me, I tense up, he blows me up with the second one, I still can't hit him and then I die.
In that case my only recommendation is practice or some sort of plant matter inhalation. 
Go play 50 DM games 

Which is better for McCree? Higher or lower sensitivity?
Not sure if I should make my sensitivity higher or lower for mcree because having higher sensitivity gives you more room to flick around and get flankers but lower sensitivity will make you more accurate.
Ultimately it's what ever you feel comfortable with. That being said, it's generally agreed upon that lower sensitivity is better providing you have the desk/mousepad space to be able to swing your arm and turn quickly to get those wider flicks and quick turns.
sayaplayer uses 1000 dpi and 5 and i feel like his mccree is the most accurate, but in general lower is more accurate. Middle ground is prob best overall, like 800 dpi and 5 sens.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpvziBnnYG4&t=76s
i use 800 dpi/ 4.2 sens, feels like a good balance between small adjustments and flicks. lots of people use lower, i think i'm on the high end of the spectrum
Go into Practice Range, strafe around the still bots right outside spawn trying to keep the crosshair on their eye. Lower if you're overshooting and raise if you're undershooting. Find a sensitivity that lets you keep easily comfortably on their eye and stick with that forever. 
Problem is, I don't have enough space to turn quickly without my mouse flying off my mousepad and I can't get a new mousepad so what should I do?
800dpi/ 4.5 sens here.
If you're limited on space then your best option is probably to use higher sensitivity. You may lower it as low as you can go and still feel comfortable with your movement in the given space you have. But I can't say how low that is.
Is it a monetary issue or a space issue, in regards to a new mousepad? There are some good ~$10-20 dollar mousepads I can point you towards if you like.
Well seems like you just answered your question 
Alright thanks.
Space issue, I can't go redesigning a whole desk because of a mousepad
If you have time, watch some of Ryujehongs videos, especially with the hand/mouse cam. He uses really low sens but can still aim well, you might want to mimic his technique.

Wrist aiming is fine too. I think Iddqd does this as Mccree and hes pretty good.
I will warn against wrist aimming, while the technique is a fine way of aiming, it is also a good way to give yourself carpal tunnel down the line. 

Disclaimer: im not a biologist and dont know if this 100% true, however it is what a few hours of research has lead me to conclude.
Correct. Hence why arm aiming generally recommended. If you see yourself fps gaming for a long time, consider getting a new desk to accomodate arm aiming.

How to train non aimintense heroes
Hey

As the title says, how do you train Heroes like Reinhardt or Mercy?

I like to play Reinhardt. I don't die too much, think Block good damage (and have often gold in eles or dmg, which I don't consider as good, just as a plus), I much more outplay the enemy Rein then he outplays me. still ranking down right now (from 2800 to 2500). Which is frustrating

The one thing I plan is to record my games. But other then that what can I do?

Coming from Starcraft: I always know what I needed to do to get better. Like focus on Macro. Once Macro works fine (and automatic) focus on scouting (When to scout, what to scout, how to react), one this works good focus on micro more while still keeping up the macro.

In Overwatch all I know to train is aim and positioning.Ex S4 Masters Rein main here. Unfortunately with Tanks, the only way to learn how to play them is through experience. Tanks require some kind of 'instinct' that develops over time. Basically your goal as tank is to force the other team to respect the ground you hold to create space for the rest of your team to do their roles. With Rein this involves knowing when to be aggressive, when to charge, when to retreat, when to go HAM, when to expect enemy rein shatters and general shield usage vs different types of enemies. You simply can't note how to do these down, you must basically build experience in how to do it yourself. Note you really should play Rein in comp where people are actually willing to work with you most of the time, Rein is very useless solo.

If you have gold elims/dmg as Rein, thats not necessarily a good thing. It may mean you are too focused on fighting rather than using your shield. This may mean the rest of the team isn't able to perform their roles efficiently. It can be frustrating sometimes just pressing M2 for the majority of the game and having the fight drawn out longer than if you just jumped in yourself and go HAM but what matters is that you win the fight with minimal losses as it enables steamrolls and superior positioning for the next fight.

For Mercy, I've never really played her due to how boring she is currently. Don't bother learning her now though, shes about to be majorly reworked. Once the changes come through then go ahead and try pick her up.
there is something I like to do with Mercy: 

Comment my gameplay
Like, I play and when I do something, I tell myself why I do that and not something else. 
That makes me play horribly, but it really helps to avoid autopiloting AND it makes me think about the things I do before I do them. 

I also like to train movements with her. Just slip of a ledge, fly back up, slip, fly, circle a little and so on. 

And watch my own VODs. Ask myself what the heck I was doing AND pick out habits I have. 
You don't need to. These heroes come down to intelligence, you ability to see a situation and know what needs to be done. Experience will also help, granted you're learning.

As with other heroes, part of playing them is knowing when to switch too. 
Most of these aimless heroes have their own internal strategies which you just have to pickup through game play. But you can be attentive to the learning process to try and improve faster. 


The other thing that you can try and train yourself on is hero countering and map sense. 


Especially with the tanks like Rein. 
There are little changes you have to adjust for depending on which heroes the enemy is fielding against you. Which ones to push in on, which ones to take more cover around, adjusting shield position to watch the high-ground, etc. some heroes tend to move in different ways (tracer, junkrat, mercy) so predicting your firestrikes and when to take a cheep swing on them varies because they move differently.  

As Rein you will tend to dictate how and where your team moves and attacks from and which ground they are going to claim as yours. Some places are better then others and it's worth looking over the maps and being Mindful about which spots work better and which work poorly. Be mindful of where you are leading your team and which spots work better.   
This will be rank and team comp dependent.  Don't take the high ground with Sym and reaper on your team and things like that. 
Think about who you are trying to protect with your shield when you're using it. Are you blocking for your backline so they aren't getting picked so you stand fast while your flanks go past you or are you running a sword and shield type strategy where you block for your close quarter fighters and pivot or push and withdraw. 
With your shield up you have the time to think about your goals of any given fight. And where to go next. Do you need to push the payload from the front or back, do you hold or fall back when they dive. 
>For Mercy, I've never really played her due to how boring she is currently.

I understand this sentiment, entirely. But I respectfully disagree. I don't think she's boring, unless she's played like a dainty winged fountain of just healing and then hiding like a moth at 100% ult charge for a resurrect. I think it's probably because I learned to love Mercy's **pistol**. It's nuts how many mercy 'mains' don't event regularly swap weapons. It's nuts how many people I've played with who don't remember the button/key they've mapped to switch weps or sometimes don't even have it mapped. Her pistol is baller. I didn't get Mercys gold weapon for the staff.. (although the broom is awesome, it's only skin I don't have for her :( ) I spent the CP for the pistol. It does quite a bit of damage if you can aim for headshots consistently. 

There's nothing like knowing the enemy Mcree is going to microwave his game disc now because you just 1 v 1'd  him *through* a stun, roll, and fan the hammer - - and won. Her pistol also gives a good amount of ultimate charge. There's many a time when, my team gets wiped and I'm close to Rez but don't have it. I'll  just fly in and go Ham, while button mashing ult, and get enough to get the rez. I find it especially rewarding if a team member doesn't have kill cams enabled... they see you pull the entire thing off. Played right, she's not boring at all. I think the worst part about mercy was how much a game could pivot solely on *her* actions/decisions. It's a lot of pressure.. On a one person.. In a 6 man team.. mercys get their fair share of hate messages for missing crucial plays.. I know I have. 

That's why I'm excited for her changes. Traditional - hide and heal, fly in and Rez Mercy mains may panic because their bread and butter is being thrown out the window.. But that definitely is boring. 

It irks me to see a mercy POTG where after rezzing her team, she just latches onto a teammate and heals them.. Or flies away. Lady. You are a *battle* angel. Pull that pistol out and show them that *The Doctor, is IN*. 


Obviously the ult is gonna be way different, but I don't think the rework negates practicing with Mercy right now. You can play her current rez like a single-target one, or at least be thinking about which person would be most important in a multi-rez.

I personally have had a hard time practicing tanks in QP, but I went on a stretch of only picking Lucio (control maps), Mercy (defense), or Ana (attack) in QP, regardless of comp, unless someone had already picked my choice or there were already two healers. It was _super_ frustrating, because people trickled, didn't protect me, etc. I frequently took breaks to go play mystery heroes. However, I feel like I really learned a lot during that week. I stayed out of comms so I could focus on mechanics and tactical skill, and because I couldn't rely on anybody to help me (or even ask for help), I had to pay attention to what was happening and adjust my positioning if I didn't want to get killed.

It was during this time that being slippery with Guardian Angel finally clicked for me, as well as using flying teammates to get out of the way (without getting _totally_ disoriented), and retreating _toward_ my team instead of backwards. I also vastly improved my sleep dart accuracy and target selection and got significantly better at escaping from flankers.

Obviously, playing healer is better when your team is paying attention to you, but I think I got a lot out of forcing myself to be self-sufficient. 
Oh hey, I found a twin!

I do those movements too! At first it was just during downtime, waiting for the round to start while setting up, etc. Just a little game of flit away '*o noes I'm falling off the gas station*' and then fly back in after doing a little twist '*j/k I still here*'. 

Anyways, this reminds me of a somethjng that happened to me. Because as time went on, I found that I naturally flexed that muscle memory of that little game, into my skill set. Early last season we were on defense at Eichenwald and it was the enemy's final gasp OT push across the bridge to the Huge doors.  

I mean just the description itself, pretty much screams 'engagement'. My team was grouped at the payload and contesting some enemies trying to push and we all new that each team had pretty much a full stack of Ults to use. We just didn't want to go first. 

It started when my Soldier decided it was time, popped his visor and got *maybe* a Sombra but also missed hearing the D.Va... flank from castle left, boost, and pop her nuke, nice and neatly above my team's head.

 Normally I would have either tried to run - to survive it (for th3 r3z), or would have tried to fly to the soldier (and died in the resulting nuclear explosion). Instead - I leapt off the bridge like a cocky bastrard... *because of that game I play*and glided juuuuuust below the blast threshold to survive it! I knew the solder would survive on high ground so I look up to GA to him.. Cause... You know.. Like everyone and their llama is asking.. 'yo. Mercy. Can you rez that?' and since I have to go save the gameaaaaaand he's out of range. Fuck. Me. 


Wings out so I'm slowly gliding, I appeal to the soldier's heroic past. 

"Soldier. Jump of that castle down to me now." 

No immediate response. He's running around, firing some shots... No comms and *certainly* no Tac Visor Either... So it's not like he's mopping up or cleaning house up there and wiping the enemy team for us.. 

"Soldier, jump of the castle *now! * or we lose the game man..."

Not a sliver of self sacrifice. But! Apparently he was trying to 1v1 a  Lucio up there during this whole thing, and promptly got
booped. (Our soldier was silent all game, but he was good. He had been tearing the enemies up there from high ground and they never contested his space effectively). They just pushed on bridge inch by inch until over time - - until along came a Lucio who decided he was going to do something about it. 

Booped soldier falls down, I GA to him as he's falling (I swear I ran the wave emote in my head, but almost shit a brick because if I fucked this up now because I waved as he was falling...) Anyways. I get enough clearance from GAing to soldier to see a 'death timer' (or whatever they're called) for my Rein.. and GA in and get a 3 man rez (I missed my roadhog but this was when he was nerfed so I wasn't to heartbroken about it). Everyone I rezzed had Ults. Wham. Bam. Thank you ~~Ma'am~~ Lucio. 

Game won. And I jump off the bridge to join silent soldier Bae. 
I was in a game last night where the Mercy got POTG by unloading a clip into Orisa's ult-bongo, a second into her moon-sized head to finish her off, and then zipped over to the team for a double res.
Yeah, fair enough. I come from a TF2 background and already have a lot of battle healer experience and didnt like it. I personally just dont like the concept of being forced to rely on teammates for self defense and if your ability to make plays involves hiding or pocketing someone. To be honest when you compare the Medic to Mercy, the Medic has the tools for self defense and is expected to use them to make him somewhat less boring, but with Mercy in her current state, I feel like its throwing if your doing anything but hiding with rez or being someones pocket/bitch. Thats why I love playing Zen instead. Its just my personal preference. I dont hate on anyone who likes playing Mercy I actually like it when I have a Mercy on my team, it gives Zen the oppurtuinity to focus less on healing and more on being aggressive.

However, the new update is very interesting. I might even start playing Mercy once it comes out.
I guess theres some benefit to learning the current Mercy. Just be careful not to build bad habits or get used to it. Rez ranges are different too.
When you read a story and you see every movement EXACTLY in your head. 

lol

well done.
What a story! And that ending when you jumped off the bridge to join soldier bae XD

Need help with understanding the new SR system!
So, like the title says I need help understanding what's going on with the SR system. I feel the game is purposely trying to demote me back into bronze. Is it because Blizzard needs a certain percentage of their players in each skill bucket?

Here are my stats for this season. After placements I started at 1665SR, I've gone 13w - 2 D - 11L and now I'm at 1568. So having a win rate of 50% means you lose 100SR ranking? Or is it the fact that you need to go 70% win rate to increase?
Short answer is yes, there must be a certain amount of bronze, but not for the reason you think. 


SR is a trade off system.  For every point one person wins some else looses. (Sorta)

Here's a rundown of how the SR system works. 
If you are in the perfect matched game everybody on both teams has exactly the same SR then which ever team wins gets the default SR change (something  close to 20 SR) and the loosing team looses the default SR. This amount fluctuates based on relative SR in two ways. 
First :  your SR relative to your team average. If your SR is below the team average (which is shown at the start of match) then you gain extra SR for the win and loose less if you loose.  If you are above team average then you win less SR and loose more then the rest of your team. (Because as top rank you should carry more then the lower rank players)
SECOND:  your team SR relative to your enemy team SR. The underdogs are expected to loose so they loose less for loosing and gain more if they win because it's an upset. Just like betting.  

But the amount of SR that changes hands still balances for the win/loss portion of SR (the Elo portion of rank).  The winners get as much as the losers loose. 

if you loose games that the SR values thinks you should probably have won then you will loose more SR then you gain from a win. 

BUT - and it's an important But -  there is a second part to SR rewards: personal performance bonus. 

Your in game performance (damage, healing, assists, kills, ult impact, head shots, etc) gets calculated for each hero you play in a match.  It gets compared to the average performance of other players at your SR value on that hero.  

If you are above the average performance values then you gain bonus SR. If you are below then you loose SR. This is win or loose. This amount is small ( somewhere between 1- maybe 10 SR -the actual max is secret-ish). It compares your performance per minute with the average. Because it's average - every player that gets extra because they are above, there is someone below average that gets a penalty. 

So if your win/ loss is 50% and your SR has gone down, one of two things have happened. Either you are loosing games that you should have won based on SR, or you are underperforming on the heroes you are using and are slowly dropping because of personal performance bonuses and penalties. 

NOTE: there have been a lot of reports of glitches in SR and some of the heroes personal performance stats are a little 'wonky' and don't result it expected bonuses. 
> If you are above team average then you win less SR and loose more then the rest of your team. (Because as top rank you should carry more then the lower rank players)

This one makes sense in theory, but I'm not sure if it's actually true. I played over 100 games last season with the same group, and the top and bottom guys both managed to stay about 300 SR apart. If anything, the gap widened slightly.

Quick question: does preferring players increase queue time?
Just something I've been thinking about, since I recently started preferring players who I played well with. Wondering if anybody had a definitive answer.Posted by Jeff Kaplan @ Battlenet

11/02/2016 06:27 PM

Hello,

Prefer this player will attempt to put you in a match with that player if there is a spot available in their match when you're in the matchmaking queue. It doesn't happen frequently because we matchmake on skill, ping, group size and other factors and don't weigh the "prefer feature" very high. It's there as more of a "hey, if it happens to line up right, I'd prefer to play with this person again."

The feature works at such a low percentage that we are considering removing it. Increasing the frequency can result in really bad/undesirable behaviors (poor matchmaking, harassment etc.) so we don't turn the dial to make it happen more often.
no it wont, how i understand it if you get put into a match with 11 other people, the match maker will try to put you in the team with those you have on prefer. it will not look further outside your game to match you.
No-one will be able to give you a 'definitive' answer unless bliz themselves want to stop by and explain.

But it's a safe bet that it's pretty doubtful it would. The obvious implementation is to factor in the preferred-player thing, along with all the other variables flying around, ONLY IF there are any preferred players online & also eligible for matching, at the time that it's checking & making decisions about who to match with who. In other words, just another variable in the same process.

Introducing extra wait times for the sake of preferred player matching (or pretty much any reason really), would be anathema to an efficient matchmaking process.

Edit: I should've read down shouldn't I, ninja'd by jeff lol
I want to know the opposite actually. If I report a player for poor teamwork and block them, I'm assuming I won't math with them again yes?
I dont think this feature guarantees you play on their side. Actually it can put them against you also. So if you only prefer good players, you may find they are often on red team and they tear you apart :)

I read that the system will only use preferred players to help chose your 12 (not 6) players - AFTER its already done SR / MMR / Group Sizes etc.

personally I am weary of using it and instead simply "add friend" on PS4 if I have good games with other MIC users and get a good win streak with them.


Okay, thanks for the clarification!
You will be matched with them, regardless if you blocked them    
There used to be a feature that acted how you described (Avoid This Player), and some highly skilled players could not find matches at high SR because everyone else at that tier used Avoid
Would like to see a source on this.
That makes sense. But I mean I'm just going to assume that I won't match throwers/leavers and continue to report/block them. Can't hurt

I'm sorry I didn't clarify, but this part of your comment is not covered:
>I dont think this feature guarantees you play on their side.  

>I read that the system will only use preferred players to help chose your 12 (not 6) players

Can you provide a source, this doesn't make sense to me.

What the hell is happening?
I lose everything game I play, last season I hit 2800 and it got me motivated then I started losing and losing, I think I am at a 10 loss streak I am a Winston main, all my other seasons I placed silver then got up to gold then climbed to play, I am not sure why I am doing so badly.Show Vod pls. Also, know when to stop playing, even if you dont think youre tilted nd playing fine (tilt is hard to notice). Never play while tilted, you wont think straight.

Some anecdotal advice: Lots of people have had huge loss streaks, only to gain back or improve their career high SR. If you belong in that rank, you get it back eventually. My biggest loss streak was around 16 (850ish SR lost) back in season 2. Blew past my career high the next week :)
Winning and losing streaks will happen just due to random chance, even quite big ones. And, if your climb to 2800 came from some lucky win streaks, it makes sense that you'd be pulled back down.

That said, I think many of the recent hero tweaks specifically make Winston's life harder. Last season, there was the Reaper buff, and he's become more common. Roadhog and Junkrat are capable of big burst damage and melting your bubble basically immediately. Orisa's improved shield and increased projectile speed means she's getting picked more, which also seems to encourage more Torbs and Bastions who can make really good use of the shield. Basically, there are a lot of characters who can pump a lot of damage into your big hitbox at a distance, where Winston can't do much, or who vastly out-damage him in Tesla-cannon range, who seem to be more popular picks this season for various reasons. Not saying that Winston is unviable, but if you haven't adjusted for the changes, you might be doing less work than last season. 
As others stated, post up vids. Also, know when to come out of comp for a while and jump into QP or arcade or else you'll find yourself falling so fast, it's not even funny. This is coming from a fallen S5 gold now climbing up from bronze.
If you lose one game, take a deep breath, get a drink of water, and shake it off before you go into your next one. If you lose the next one, leave it alone for a while. Even if you're not tilted, you're going to have a defeated mentality going into it, and that won't help anything.
I will be posting vod soon (in school atm) thanks for all the advice.
I can't say for sure cause I don't know the specifics of your story but I would imagine that part of the reason you were able to come back higher than your career high after the losing streak was possibly because of a win streak. You essentially sling shot yourself by getting low enough that you were able to have a larger impact on your matches which resulted in some easier wins and maintained that wave until you past your peak.

Win/lose streaks don't work quite like they used to so you're unlikely to lose as much SR and gain as much SR on streaks (unless perhaps they get really big). In general it's harder for your SR to fluctuate as wildly as before on streaks. That's not to say it can't or won't happen. It's just supposed to much more difficult now than it was S4 or earlier.
Yes, you're right. I imagine that they cancel out though e.g. If I had the dame loss streak now, I wouldve lost less SR, meaning theoretically its easier to get back to your real rank.

However, (more anectdotal evidence) I feel its easier to get hardstuck into a rank now, like I dont have to worry about deranking as badly, but now the climb feels way more grindier. I think the key here is try and reduce the amount of time you spend at an SR to avoid having your MMR set at that level, otherwise youre basically stuck there.

How do you turn your mistakes into good habits?
In a fast-paced game like Overwatch, it can be extremely hard to think about what you're doing wrong when you're in the moment. Generally I catch my mistakes when I die or after the match has ended, so I've been watching my VoDs and keeping a list of things I can work on. However, I've been thinking about how I can turn those things into good habits during my play. It's like the list gets longer and longer, but you can't possibly remember every single little habit you've written down somewhere, right?

So, how do you all do this? If you do at all?You start by focusing on one bad habit at a time and turning it into a good habit. Once it's habitual you don't have to think about it anymore. So don't worry about the whole list of things. Just pick out one or two things to improve on and once you see that you're consistently improving on those areas then pick another one or two things to work on.
- next time I should do this instead
- next time: shit i did the same bad thing again, i'll try harder to remember to do this better thing instead
- next time: i didn't do the bad thing again but i didn't quite do what i wanted to do instead because it's not muscle memory yet and i messed it up. Will try to execute better next time
- next time: avoided doing the bad thing again and got closer to doing what I should do instead
- next time
- next time

What's wrong with my aim and how can I fix it? (video included)
Hi, that McCree dude's back. I've been noticing recently that I keep on overflicking or underflicking, or maybe even shooting too early. I can't describe it and I'm at my odds ends on ways to get rid of [this horrible aim.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkQZOVr2Hvs) Any advice or tips? All comments are appreciated, thanks! :DYou should try being more patient with your shots, try tracking a bit more instead of flicking. That will help with more general aim. And try counting your shots in your head so you don't run out of any when you flash someone. Hope this helps
Two routes you can go:

* Manually flick between every shot. When doing this you need to flick away to a known resting point and then flick back. Don't do this fast and eventually you will get get a consistent flick in one direction (e.g: You shoot, move cursor to right side of target, flick back to land the shot). Start slow and gradually increase the speed of these flicks. If you flick too fast you will shoot faster than recoil adjusts and shots will land too high.

* You can also just hold in left click and track the target. Can also do the same flickinging as above while holding LMB but its harder and you have to adjust your crosshair a tiny bit since it will shoot again before your recoil fully adjusts (meaning 2./3. shot will land higher than first). 

To practice lucio bots are fine but you should add more variety of heroes. You also need some drills to make flash -> headshot automatic. E.g: Put in some zarya bots with no shields enabled so you can drill that headbob.
Stop practising with lucio bots. I would rather warmup/practice on FFA deathmatch.
Take it slow with shots, make them count. It's like you prioritize getting shots off over hitting with them. I know I do and my McCree looks just like that.
Alright, thanks guys :D
1 shot should equal one click. Don't spam. Don't flick, instead track and make sure your crosshair is head level and then shoot.

It helped me, and on DM FFA i consistently have 50%+ accuracy with mccree.

When your aim improves you can incorporate flicking, and you'll be away more accurate, and deadly.
Have you tried optimizing input lag? I improved my aim significantly by reading guides and watching videos on how to reduce input lag. If you've done that, then upgrading your monitor to 144hz if it's in your budget can make a huge difference.
since you seem to shoot too early most of the time, try increasing your sensitivity a bit?

you can't tell from the video, but focus on looking where you want to shoot at, that is "the magic trick" to improve aim. i learned while getting my drivers license that in a dangerous situation when i have to do an evasive maneuver never look at the obstacle you want to avoid, look at the way you want to take to avoid it.

or same as the tennis teacher says to children learning tennis not hitting balls, look at the ball
And don't flash when you're out of ammo...
>What's wrong with my aim?

you're missing

>how can I fix it?

practice
To clarify other readers: you almost never want to just hold the lmb all the way. Always click each shot. Much more accurate. 
Listen man, as much as I agree with you, that's never a consistent thing. Sometimes I'm the first to finish 20 people who are all at less than 50 health, sometimes I'm the first to die to 20 people who are all roadhogs. Some people stand still as Bastion, some people dick around as Tracer. Sometimes I'm against Masters, sometimes I'm against low Silvers. Lucio bots are a pretty accessible way to see your aim, and you can switch it up with other hero bots, and it'll be fairly consistent everytime. :D
Hey you might want to consider locking your fps. You're running very fast there but consistent input lag is more important than fast. I saw you fluctuate between 170 and 220.

If you get into situations where a lot of ults are popping off at once you could have double the input lag as you're used to just fighting one lucio bot (say situations that drop you to 160).

Even if it's not a direct improvement, locking your FPS at say 155 or 170 will remove one variable out of your aim. You'll eventually get used to having a fairly consistent input and hit registration will feel much better.

I play at 75hz but I'm still locked at 145 because SIM is that much faster. I just turned it up from 90 FPS and it feels sooo much better. Press Shift+Ctrl+N to take a look at your SIM. As far as I know values are low/avg/high. Lock your FPS to the lowest you've seen (check it next big fight when a lot of ults are happening).

Edit: I'd still do what I've said above, but I'm wondering if your sens is too high as it looks like you're having trouble making micro movements. What's your DPI + in game sens?
But can you be more specific? What kind of practice would you suggest?
For me personally, holding the button helped my aim because I could concentrate on just tracking by itself. 
The movement with bots is unnatural and you will fall into bad aim habits. I know because it happened to me. Pretty much the same type of "lazy aim" as you. Switched the 30-60 minute bot warmup to 15min of Aim Hero and 30-45min of FFA deathmatch. I try to avoid using abilities so I can properly warm up my aim. Theres a good video on warming up from a youtuber called ioStux you should check out.
When you play DM are you trying to win or trying to practice your aim?
Bots really isn't the way to go for good reasons as the other user replied. 

I use to be a horrible person hitscan player. After much reading practice on quickplay and comp I am at a much better place now. 

Live gameplay is much better for multitude of reasons. It's just that much more efficient 
I am currently running at 800 DPI and 6.13 in-game sens. You bring up a good point with the FPS fluctuation though, I'm considering locking my FPS as it is weird to see maybe 120 fps and 280 in the same game. Wouldn't help my shots either, I'd assume :D
Practice aiming at peoples heads. You know, in games and stuff.
You're on the upper end of reasonable sens. Try lowering it to 3 in game sens for 15 minutes. 6 will feel *fast as balls* after switching back. If not, maybe don't switch. I play 3 x 1200 which is effectively the same. We can mostly rule out your mouse settings as being a problem.

You should be using your arm to aim to different targets and your wrist to focus shots. As long as you can focus different body parts of your target as a sniper, your sensitivity is probably fine.

What I'm trying to do ultimately is troubleshoot. We cant do that without restarting the computer first ;p.
If you insist on Lucio bots, please take it down to two, and have them do half damage to you instead of no headshots. Give yourself something to worry about.

I use easier lucios as a crutch while I'm aiming. I'll change aim from the one that's been giving me trouble to the other heading straight for me. You really do have to practice. By giving yourself 6 targets, you can focus the easiest target -- that messes up your aim training soooooo hard.

It's really easy to change gears because none of them are really posing a threat. Realistically, every enemy will be moving more erratically and posing more of a threat. If you keep shooting lucios please note this.
The lowest I've ever ran McCree at was 5.5 sens @ 800 DPI, anything below it and I can't flick at all man. On the other hand, I do see the accuracy part of low senses as it was easier to hit say, a Torb turret than to maybe flick over it 1 out of 8 times with high sens. But who knows, maybe I'll try it and get to GM ;D

Looking for a video about aiming.
There was a video about aiming, i cant seem to find it. It talked about tracking a luico until it boops you then switching to the other lucio. I really just want to find this video. I've scavenged the internet looking for it. I know it was posted here somewhere in the comments but i really cant find it.

How to convince my roommate to improve his mechanical skill to play Ana better?
I sometimes duo q with one of my roommates.

He's never been good at FPS games. But he picked up mercy in S4 and somehow got his rank in line to my rank (masters). He's basically a one-trick.

Now since S6 he's insisting on playing Ana whenever he can. Problem is he is terrible at it and is starting to affect my rank when i play with him. He has terrible mechanical skill and its quite obvious but denies it because he usually has "70% accuracy most games".

I've watched him play and he just basically pads his stats by standing right behind his tanks and spamming shots even when they're fully healed.Have him play McCree a couple games and see how he does. Should help expose how bad his aim really is.
Dont go ruining friendships over games first and foremost.

You are the one who needs to figure out just how open your friend is to criticism in this matter, and you should know best how to approach him. Dont just take any advice from strangers in the internet.
1v1 him on Ana.
Try doing 1v1s with him. It's a good way to practice and he might even enjoy it.
Urge him to play Ana Paintball Deathmatches in Custom Games. If he really has good mechanical skills with Ana, he should prevail there right? Let him learn the hard way. 

tell him to record his matches and force him to watch all the mistakes he makes
Prove it to him by beating him in a 1v1 or playing some Ana Paintball together and see how he does. Once he realises his Ana needs work, then get him to check out other resources too.

Maybe get him to check out /r/AnaMains and see the guides on there: https://redd.it/6d6lbd

There's also a list of streamers and YouTubers who play Ana in the sidebar there, watching them might give him an idea of how Ana should be played and maybe he'll realise how different the impact they have compared to him.


How do you know it's mechanical skill that needs work. Just curious 
Go on his career profile and show him his win percentage with Mercy vs with Ana. If its as bad as you say , hell stop because people want to win.
70% even with accuracy padding is really bad lol
He could get a smurf, and start playing her there. Or play her when he's solo. 
I learned a lot of heroes almost all of them, and every time I picked up a new hero, my SR went down for a while. My friends that I Q with don't have to suffer with me. I don't try to learn new heroes with them. 
I second this. That's what I did to learn how to pick up Ana. I wouldn't touch her on my main in competitive until I was fully confident in my ability with her on my smurf. It really helped save me some frustration. 
This, I mostly play in a six man with friends as a DPS, and I mainly play hitscan. Each time I pick up a new hero (I used to one trick McCree) such as soldier, tracer or genji, I solo queued for about a week and if my sr was still stable or about he same  I'd go back and play 6 mans

Thoughts on Kill Cam Off or On?
Do you find it provides enough valuable information to leave it on? 

I tend to leave it off to help prevent tilt. On- you can always skip. But it wil tell you how close to ult the enemy is. Cool downs and for dym where her turrets are (by that hidden tp) 
Always on. You're blinding yourself to seeing the opposing team's ult status if you keep it off.

If you're tilting look at the ult meter, then immediately skip.
I had it off for awhile for the same reason...tilt. The thing is that if you're in a mindset to tilt, you'll find something else to cause it anyway. And you're missing out on valuable information. So I'd say definitely keep it on and then try to work on tilt through other methods.

Edit: And I'd actually add that watching precisely how you died is itself one method of alleviating tilt. You didn't die to some random bullshit most likely. You died to a combination of a good action of the opponents and a poor action of yourself. Being able to rationally analyze this play can do a lot to combat tilt because it (hopefully) takes you out of the realm of pure emotion.
When you're first starting the game, ABSOLUTELY LEAVE IT ON.  It is *so* useful to know exactly how you died.  Absolutely mandatory for self improvement.

As you play the game more, you'll start to get a better understanding of your deaths, and you'll be able to see what you did wrong before the killcam even starts.  In that case, you can skip it.

Also, you can see your enemy's ult charge, as other people have mentioned.
Sometimes you just gotta know... HOW THAT HOOK GOT ME!?!?!
I leave mine on, but skip it most of the time to watch my teammates. I might watch if I couldn't tell where an enemy came from or something like that, but I usually want to see what's happening live, especially in comp. And in quickplay, you get to see why your team is struggling. Namely 2 of them are dancing together 200 meters from the point. :/
Most times I know the mistake I made even before watching it so I just skip it. 
I'm still surprised they still allow killcalms on competitive because of the advantage they can give.  At least not showing the enemy HUD would fix it. 
ON, ON! OOOOONNN!!!

I hate myself for skip it so much without meaning =T

I keep pressing space bar just because is an nervous tick and I want to know how did I died, but this jumps the kill cam...

What you get from watching kill cams:

1. Enemy flanker positioning

2. Enemy Ult status

3. Can catch a hacker


I leave it off, not for tilt, but because i like to see the game as it happens from my teams eyes the entire time I'm not in the action.
I turn it off. You give up being able to see their ult which is a downgrade. But you also get to not reset the killfeed which helps in keeping score of the fight and calling out to pull out / hold ults. You can also watch people's flanks and what's going on. It's a trade off but it's been helpful for me
I like it on
I use it to see what mistake I made. It can be tilting if it's pure luck but it can be a huge learning opportunity
On, definitely.
it should be disabled in scrims/tournaments and probably even in comp

as for your own settings i wouldnt disable it, its a disadvantage
As most others have said, definitely keep it on. The only time you want to manually skip it is after you see the ult charge and if you have potential to be rezzed - this allows you to keep track of the fight and the killcam.

Its also really nice if you're in a rank where mechanics are highly variable. Killcams make it really easy to differentiate lucky or "random" kills vs wow that guy's reticle is like a friggin magnet to my face.

Also I'm kinda curious..what part of the killcam is tilting you?
I usually watch it to see how close an enemy is to an ult that I can relay to my team. Or if I noticed that I died ina stupid way I can learn from my mistakes. Lessons learned. If I died stupidly like trying to run through a hallway with a charging Rein, I'll skip so I. An cycle through my team and their performance or target locations. 
I can't always skip. Maybe there's a setting I have wrong or it's my platform (PS4) but sometimes on deathcam I press a button and it just stays on. Kind of frustrating when I'm trying to track ults or just see how the battle is going post-death.
^This, and it provides a different perspective of the kill, so you can see what you could have done differently to survive in third person.
Ive actually always been surprised that killcam is on competitive for that reason. 

I feel like it unnecessarily gives a lot of information about the enemy team. 
Yeah, I use it to calm myself down. It's not automatic, but rather, I force myself to watch what happened, and it helps.

Frequently I see that I was completely retarded. Just wandering in front of everyone, all by myself, easy pickings. It can be very humbling!

I also like seeing what percentage someone killed me with. If they only contributed 50%, then I know multiple people were hammering me, rather than simply losing a duel. It's a different kind of mistake.
"Oh, I deserved that"
-me watching the kill cam.
I was totally going to post the same thing. If it's not the tilt-can it's going to be something else. Fix that first. 
good in theory but the amount of killcams I've seen where I've been killed by a literally random hanzo shot is crazy. Still it is 100% worth it to have it on as for the most part it alleviates tilt and shows vital information
Unless you were killed by a Junkrat, or a Dva bomb, or something similar. Then the killcam doesn't help. 
Also gives you tips on if a player is cheating or not, so you don't end up mixing skill with "WOW, HAX!" For example: i was playing sombra and went to my translocator while invisible, only for an Ana to sleep me from a good distance away the moment I teleported. Normally I would accuse them of hacks or cheating (since i was undetected), but in the killcam i saw that she was aiming for a Hanzo directly behind me and got lucky.
IIRC it might be that you have different control bindings for different heroes. I think that technically it's the 'jump' button that you've set for the hero you're currently spectating which skips deathcam.
It's your jump button 
Thanks, I'll have to try that out! I remapped a lot of heroes (S76, Tracer, Sombra, Lucio, Pharah, Genji, Hanzo, Mei, Bastion, Mercy) to jump with a trigger so this could be why it sometimes works and sometimes doesn't.  
Oh boy this was super frustrating when I tried out console.

Heal on left trigger and dmg boost on right trigger

switch to torb

build turret on left trigger and single shot on right trigger, shotgun on right bumper

BAHHH Maybe my friend rebinded some buttons but damn that was so hard to learn 
Same, and this is totally the problem. I only found out when I got mad playing Hanzo when the deathcam wouldn't skip and I banged my controller down, hitting ltrigger, and it skipped! No more tilt
Many of life's woes can be solved by banging the controller down.

Newb Resources?
Hi guys, Dota player interested in starting out on Overwatch. FPS experience was limited to a small amount of TF2, and I've played Dota for a while at a reasonably advanced level. Looking for some beginner's guides/resources before I get going.
[iOstux's Getting Good at OW series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mo3jjf8FU8&list=PLmT-z3WqrQzScRMHsJ4Q7n-Vv8mCYDRxo) is a good start for fundamentals and basics. Most of his videos are worth watching.

Depending on the heroes you're thinking about maining i could link a few guides. 

In general just play all the heroes until you know them well. Once you feel comfortable pick a couple from each category (DPS, tank, support) and focus on improving them. You want to be flexible but not to a fault
/u/Grrym has some great links for the key people to listen to. I'd recommend to avoid the major YouTube personalities such as: Your Overwatch, Stylosa (unit lost), ohnickel and the like for they tend to regurgitate community ideas and misinform the playerbase (ppl will disagree with me here, it's my personal opinion only).

Here are a few more links of use:

I have many other guides on aiming, specific hero guides, pick counters, SoloQ climbing and the like. If you are interested let me know and I can share more.  
If you ever feel like joining an active, growing and positive [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) community that has bronze to GM level players, DM me and I'll send you an invite.

Play the game a little bit yourself. I really miss the early hours of Overwatch where I had no idea what to do and I played heroes that I liked and learned things that way. After that, I personally recommend [Seagull](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaFnEJ5tWlK0TO5PWHqr8Hw/videos). He's a pro/streamer who's always giving tips and analyzing his/team/enemy's mistakes while playing. He taught me everything I know about Overwatch
/r/overwatch university has some good info
This subreddit is an excellent place to start and I would also suggest watching the Your Overwatch YouTube channel.  They have the best Overwatch content on YouTube imho.  
Winston, Torbjorn, Symmetra ar good picks to learn gamesense.
Do not worry about your aiming skills at all!

The least required skill to become good on OW is aiming.

This is an game about team work (like 10 times more team work than Dota tbh)
Thanks fam!
Soldier, dva, and Lucio were recommended to me as starter heroes
I needed this too so thanks for the info
Thanks fam!
You know where you are, right?
Your Overwatch pushes out a lot of shitty, fast content. They're just in it to make money
If one more newbie comes into this game thinking that Sombra's a motherfucking support I'm going to lose my mind. People need to stop listening to them. It's not hard to put out quality content, and at one point they used to, they've just stopped trying. 
[removed]
Those are all great choices. 
OOPS see that's my bad it's been a long day. 
[removed]
Don't feel bad, I have like 6 overwatch subs and I never know which is which just based on content 
You're just taking things too seriously 
I'm not even going to delete it. I accept my mistake.
I'm trying to help this guy, you're just being rude.
The quote is "You're taking this very seriously" btw 
Sir. You are the future of the world. Knowing when you are wrong.
"I need a drink"
To this day it confuses me how people continue to fight for something small even when they're wrong. The second I realize I'm wrong I jump ship on whatever it was like a rat, I want to actually be right. 

Resources for Reaper play?
I've been looking around for good Reaper streamers and found [these](https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchUniversity/comments/69knvc/request_best_video_channels_great_players_and/dh7b7m4/) [lists](https://www.reddit.com/r/OverwatchUniversity/comments/68kfpo/made_a_list_of_useful_youtuberspro_players/), both highly detailed but missing Reaper entirely. Are there any good sources of advanced Reaper gameplay, or does just no one play him at a high level?Spirit: https://twitch.tv/spiritow
reaper is a very simple hero so theres not much depth tbh but watching reaper streams dont hurt
Thanks! 
Many heroes are simple but even the most simple heroes still have intricacies that, if mastered, can make you a dominating force. Simplicity doesn't mean there isn't good information to be learned about proper positioning and engagement and such.

Fresh account placement range
Hello fellow students and professors,

Just a quick question regarding an accounts very first placement matches: obviously your rough rank will be determined by your quickplay mmr, but is there a certain capped range that you can place at? 

So for example, let's say you can neither place above 3500 nor below 1000. Is anything like this the case?For *fresh* accounts, even for smurfs, I think Blizzard capped it to under Masters. I don't think I've seen any of my T500 friends place straight into Masters on their smurfs as of recent.
I think it is under masters
I've never seen someone place under 800 nor above 4000

Mid plat vod review request - genji/soldier
I have dropped a bit, normally I play mid diamond. This was a really close game, where I had the idea I only made some minor mistakes, and we lost by a small margin. thanks in advance!

Looking for a guide on how to get higher fps
Anyone have a link or any tips on how to get higher fps? I have a gtx 1080, i7 6700k, and 16 gb of ram. On all low settings aside from high textures and 100% render quality, I am only getting around a constant 160 fps.What does your screen setting say in "video" options in OW? because that number after your 1080x1600 60* or whatever is how many Frames your screen can support, regardless of your GPU. so if it's (60*) then set your Framerate to custom and 70 and just be happy till you get a better screen... 
>> now lets pretend that you have a great monitor that supports over 200, then set your video settings to 200, low on almost everything. and if that still doesn't fix it, put your rendering at 75% and that should stable it. this will take many restarts of your game, but should fix it, if not, then your screen or your gpu is crapping out.. also make sure your NVidia gtx settings are set to max settings for OW. 

>> Plus watch this - [Click Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ez2ZXjU4rWc)
That doesn't seem quite right for that kind of gpu but I'm not an expert.

Some general basic tips are to lower settings, like you've already done but you may even drop textures to medium and try that (textures was the biggest thing holding back my gtx 1060). You can also make sure you're on fullscreen rather than borderless windowed. Make sure your display setting matches the resolution of the monitor and the frequency of the monitor. You can reduce render scale to help.

There's probably some other things you could look at too. But ultimately, if you're using a 144hz monitor and getting consistent 160fps (not dipping below 144 at least) then you're fine. You may even want to lock your fps to 144 just so you get consistent input lag. Generally, the higher the fps the lower the input lag but fps spikes can mess up that input lag a bit, even if you don't dip below 144hz to visually see the frame drops. I used to think that the more fps the better and that having a majority of the time be higher and even if it spiked down sometimes it was still best to keep as high as possible. I've recently learned that consistency is more important that trying to squeak out as many frames as possible. 
Hm, those numbers seem off. What kind of RAM do you have, and what is your 6700k overclocked to?

I'm running a GTX 1070, i7-2600k @ 4.2GHz, and DDR3-1866 RAM (locked to 1600 MHz from the CPU), almost all settings max except for a select few, and my FPS ranges from 130-180 with ShadowPlay enabled on 4K resolution.

You should be getting significantly better FPS than I am.
Corsair vengence and honestly i do not believe my processor is overclocked at all, any tips on how to do that?
1920x1080 (144)
So yah if I had that I would be perfectly happy.

How Will We Deal with Junkrat after D.Va Nerf?
Junkrat is now the highest played DPS character at ever tier, according to the meta report. So how do we deal with Junkrat? I've had quite a few games now where Junkrat holds a choke simply by spamming. So how do you do it? Played a REALLY strong defense on Eichenwald where they had DVA/Zarya/Junkrat/Symm/Soldier/Ana. They had a Dva to control the bridge. They had a soldier to police the skies. They had Zarya, Junkrat, Soldier, and Ana spamming down choke. They had a team wipe ready with Zarya Grav, and my team wasn't able to stand in choke long enough to kill symm turrets. I finally got my team to go Dva/Winston to eat spam and take out turrets, but on the one push we had with that comp, the DVa didn't know what he was supposed to do, and the Winston died to spam.

Regardless... this is going to get even worse with the new Dva. Play nice play pharah
Cancer comps, especially at maps with good chokes, can be very difficult to deal with as the defense is generally easier to execute effectively than its counter.

Regardless, Pharmercy will still be pretty effective on many maps against Junkrat comps. Zarya is still a good soft counter, and Tracer/Sombra are effective at high levels (diamond+ for Tracer, master+ for Sombra.) Dive comp can still work in some situations; Junkrat melts to Dive if successful (although it is risky.) Dva may still be part of a good composition against Junkrat still; only time will tell.
Zarya and hog can work- high charge burst shield open with hook. Also try dive to just push in fast
Tbh, this is just season 1 all over again.

Everybody thinks that Junkrat is OP, then an month latter people start to realise that they don't need to step on his shots that are really easy to avoid...

What is weak against junkrat:

1. Dive, jumping on a Junkrat is suicidal, is the same that trying to fight a raeper face to face, not a smart move boy. Junkrat is an GREAT comp to divers, specially winston and doomfist.

2. small rooms, Junkrat will take advantage of walls and small corridors to take you and your team out, if they have a junkrat don't go trough the small corridors on 1st point numbani for example, is asking to die

What is strong against Junkrat:

1. High Ground, he can jump on high grounds now with the extra mine and have a chance to fight. But it isn't his strong, stay higher than him to avoid his bombs

2. Open areas, Junkrat hate an open area and will lose to a single mercy if she is smart do avoid his bombs

3. Fights that are +15m away from him, he can do great being far on a choke point, but if you're on the open and far from him, will be almost impossible to him fight you

What counters junkrat:

1. D.Va, before changes is the strongest counter for junkrat, pharah and bastion, but it will change and she will be weak against Junk

2. Pharah, she can fly and is close to impossible for junk to win, he have an chance if pharah isn't smart or he gets pretty lucky with his shots, but if we talk about lucky even a Lúcio can 1v1 a RoadHog

3. Soldier 76, he always was an strong counter to junk, stays on high grounds, can shot from far without problems and his weapon is in a big advantage against a junkrat (Specially if we count the biotic field, since you can heal part of his damage and avoid an insta kill via combos)

4. Zarya, she isn't really a counter, but she LOOOVES the enemy junkrats, even the worst zaryas can have 100% charge for an entire match with an junkrat on the enemy team

5. Genji, deflect + high mobility makes him an hero that is in a big advantage against a junkrat, just go after he spends his mines to increase chances

____

If the enemy junkrat is like an pvptwitch / chro and is destroying you guys, you can even make an comp with tons of advantage against him like

Reinhardt + Zarya + Pharah + Soldier + Mercy + Lúcio (No one on this comp will have big problems to deal with Junkrat at all!)


_____

> defense on Eichenwald where they had DVA/Zarya/Junkrat/Symm/Soldier/Ana

So, you could have an easy win against  this comp

Zarya, Junkrat and Symmetra had no chances against an Pharmercy, you would only need some tries to make your Pharah destroy their soldier and clean everyone else

Would help to use an Junkrat and spam at D.va making her waste her D.M. (Shotting to the bridge isn't hard) or you could use an Tracer, the player would need to be good, but he would be able to destroy symmetra tele and sym herself

Having an Winston was the worst part, since he have no chances against an Junkrat, even if you see him breaking sym turrets, a Reinhardt could break them as well while an D.Va used DM to protect him and he could go shield after

So the comp I would suggest is:

Pharah - Mercy - Reinhardt - Lúcio (speed to help Rein to move with the shield) - D.Va (Go zarya after nerf) - Tracer (if Tele is bothering) or Junkrat (if the D.Va DM is stopping the Pharah)
What about bastion?
Can you link the meta report?
I will never understand why they gave him double concussive mines. Rip Tire buff? Absolutely needed.

With no self damage.
Don't know how comp works, but other than Pharah, Genji can pickoff junkrat pretty well if you manage to deflect the mine + some bombs.

Other than that, he can just concussion mine away from a lot of heroes. Not sure about team comps and stuff.
Tracer. Find an amazing tracer to put on your team. They will melt a junk, Ana, Roadhog, a current DVa, etc. Most people are suggesting dive, and that's the best I can think of at the moment. It's more important that your Tracer can bust through a choke and pick off supports than anything, but they need to be very good at staying alive. 
Treat Junkrat like a Bastion. With Bastion, you build comps around killing him (soldier/pharah/zen/dva) and focus firing him first before moving onto the rest of the team. After that, it's hard for a Bastion to set up again. Similarly, if you focus Junkrat first, you prevent him from doing damage and make it harder for him to be effective since he excels in closed off areas.
Pharah will always dumpster Junkrat if they're on relative skill levels. New Mercy can also undo Junkrat's damage by removing any picks he does get. 

Zarya can't counter him directly but can feast on his spam to plough the rest of his team. Orisa can also deal with Junkrat by pulling him/his team out of position, and can throw out shields at a rate where Junkrat's spam window is weakened. 

Long-rand hitscan, especially at high ranks where players don't miss, slam dunk Junkrat. In particular, McCree and Widow have big burst damage to kill Junkrat before he can respond (Flashbang, Charged Headshot). The new cooldown for Widow also makes it easier for her to flank Junkrat by grapple-jumping and one-shorting him. 

Sombra also screws over the team surrounding Junkrat as well as removing his escape mechanism. If you hack first, Sombra should win 1v1s against the Rat by one-clipping him. 
A well placed D.Va bomb would have opened that choke. 

Maybe. Mid-high plat has no idea how to beat such comps. Me and others are often left wondering what to do. 
I'm surprised how well I've done playing against Junkrat with Orisa.  Maybe it's because i'm playing high diamond, but I pull him up and he gets shot pretty easily by a Pharah flying above
I lived enough to see Junkrat being not only viable but one of the best picks in the Game.  O.O 
Shields from Zarya and Orisa work well. Since he's spamming, he's not aiming at something in particular. So it is sensible to think a barrier would deny Junkrat from ultimate charge.

Of course, you can also help your Pharmercy with a bubble from time to time, and in return they will help you by unleashing hell on those you catch in the graviton.

uhm you learn to keep your distance and avoid tight rooms/ways
Shoot 'em in the 'ead. 'EADSHOT!
Get high ground.
I'm finding running a hog in the second dps slot works well, zarya, rein/Orisa/Winston in the tank slots. Seems like a return to triple tank sort of comps might do OK but the presence of doomfist makes this sort of comp easy to punish, so having a hog as third tank/second dps counters doomfist well. 
I know as a former Junkrat main, especially attacking, I struggle with Symmetra if her turrets are staggered on multiple eye levels. It took me too long to break down a well separated car wash. She's also harder to hit than you think by being able to jump behind you locked on.

I, even just buying a golden gun a couple weeks ago, resign the title of Junkrat main because of the unskilled nature it's taken on. Everyone can play Junk serviceable at their level. It's like being a Mercy main, but also being the dick that locks DPS, simultaneously. 
Pls no more Pharmercy
Playing pharah is basically cheating though. There's a reason people feel like crap when they swap to her just to win.
TBH I shit on pharah as junk
I'm curious if Hog will become a natural counter. He can bust down the defense that protects junkrat, and pull him out of situations where junkrat is dangerous in order to create a space where he's harmless. On top of that, the breather change allows him to tank hits to threaten junk's space.
I guess the new Mercy will be a good counter to the new Junkrat.
Dva 1v1 against a Junkrat isn't too bad in the PTR, especially if you get the drop on him. The problem is that Dva is almost instantly de-meched if Junkrat has even one teammate with him.

Once her short matrix is down she doesn't have much armor to protect herself anymore and she is very easy to crit. The new Dva is hell with a good Mercy pocketing her, but she can't do anything on her own anymore without getting pushed out of mech.

On the PTR I can guarantee a kill almost every fight, but at the cost of my mech which I might not get back fast enough to help in the next fight.
It still boggles the mind tho when the balances get to a point you need 3 to 4 heroes to counter the effects of just one hero, and thats not even taking into account whether or not hes being well supported by his team or not.
I'm not gonna play Pharmercy just to win. I'd seriously rather flat out lose than belittle my opponents with that stupidity.
Zarya seems like a great pick. We had a hog, and they had no shield to burst. His hooks were getting bubbled too.
I've really enjoyed Zarya/Hog this season as Zarya.  He is a super-reliable source of charge, and he and I can kill pretty much anything.

The problem is that the rest of the team is own their own.  No shield, and the bubble's for Hog.  Reaper ults, D.va ults, etc. cause major problems.  Maybe we need triple tank again, so D.va can eat the hitscan and reaper ults.  For now.
I find winston disruptive as Junk. He can't really kill me, but I have trouble killing him when he lands on my team and drops a shield. Disrupts my damage output and where I want to put my mines/traps
Not to be a grammar nazi but just friendly reminder- 

"an" is used when there is a vowel or vowel sound on the next word. "A" is used instead. So "a junkrat" not "an junkrat". 
What about widow.
Probably not a good idea because bastion has to set up in turret mode to be effective and junkrat can quickly burst bastion down and can also damage him from much further away. 
Bastion to deal with Junkrat or how are people going to deal with bastion without Dva?

It's a good point. How do you beat a Junkrat, Bastion, Symmetra? MAYBE you go Pharah and sneak up on them... unless they also have a Mercy/Teleporter.
Double mines = 

Allow him to stand a chance against his biggest counters, Pharah and Soldier

There was absolutely no way to deal with an Pharah, now you can scare her with the mines

Soldier was always on High grounds and after you spend your mine to jump at him, your weapon won't be good enough to give you an fair fight on the high ground.

He counters Pharah and SOldier now? Absolutely NOT, but he can have chances
Yeah, I think he just has way too much burst damage now.  If the mines were designed for using one to jump and another to damage, they should do less damage.  Because Junkrats are using them to kill two people in close quarters instantly.  It's like they gave Hanzo two scatter arrows and a CC ability, and you don't have to aim.  A little overpowered.

I play pretty much everyone except Pharah.  Time to learn, I guess.
Because concussive mine is the most consistent and reliable part of his kit, so if Blizzard's goal is to increase Junkrat's presence at the highest tiers, it makes perfect sense to emphasize that ability which already rewards skill and make it reward skill even more.
>  well if you manage to deflect the mine + some bombs

I mean... the problem is in choke points. So Junkrat can just spam down a choke, and it's OP. If he gets into duels he's super OP now because he always has a mine up, which one shots squishy characters, and it helps him escape if necessary. Maybe you can get into a good position to flank and deal with junkrat one on one... but maybe not because they do have Zarya/Symmetra. 
As a junk player Tracers don't bother me much.  Trap and mine to the face
The difference is that Bastion has to see you to shoot you. Junkrat can fight in small rooms. Bastion is disadvantaged there because people find cover.
Yeah, I didn't really think about that until I made the thread lol. 
I've been playing her a lot recently and her right click is very good against the Rat. If he's sitting on high ground peaking I can pull him off high ground or out of cover. I can also lay down suppressing hire that keep him pinned down. Halt can also ruin his mine jumps when he's trying to get away.

The shield is 50/50. If Junkrat alone is wasting shots against it, then I'll usually have a new one on cooldown by the time he busts it down. If he has backup, then I'll be backtracking pretty fast. However, I can usually Fortify and survive long enough to up my next shield. I'll lose ground, but not as quickly as a Reinhardt would.

Edit: I would also like to thank all the "new" Junkrat mains this season who still think it's a good idea to spam my shield instead of firing over it or around it. There's just something hypnotizing about big blue barriers isn't there?
I will keep my distance from chokes? 
Weird. I feel like the exact opposite. Hog can't do much against junkrat. Neither can rein. If you land a hook he can quickly escape while dealing a lot of damage. All you do is charge his ult, which is sort of OP now because it always kills something. 
BEST counter to pharmercy: Torb. Turrets placed to target skies more than ground, add a shield for some reinforcement. Pharmercys HATE this. Ask them! They talk about it here. In reddit.
This turned from how to counter pharmercy to who counters törbjorn. Good job reddit.


I'm learning and loving Tracer right now, and my absolute favorite thing to do is catch Pharah on her way down from the sky and kill her before she can figure out where she's being shot from.

I'm sure good Pharahs never come close enough for that to work, but in bronze, it's happened several times.
Neat.
Yeah gotta love the hitscan arcing grenades. 
How do you slow your jumps to defecate so accurately ?
As a Junkrat main, I can confirm that right now the thing that will have me backing up and running away the fastest is when a Hog starts walking my direction. Sometime I get lucky and can escape with a concussion mine after being hooked, but if he pulls me into his team, or out into the open, I'm as good as dead, and I simply can't bring him down fast enough to avoid dying to him. Even pharah doesn't deter me from my favorite positions quite the way the current Hog does.
If a junkrat required that level of effort in every situation, I'd say there was an imbalance. However, I feel like the specific situations where he's *that* strong are highly dependent on multiple factors (such as heroes supporting him, specific chokes where he's strong, other team's comp, etc.).

If junkrat was solo holding a choke against 4 other players, that would definitely be an imbalance.
Overwatch is a team game and Blizzard assumes that there is going to be some teamwork. The problem is that in low MMR overwatch solo queue quickplay and ranked, people treat the game as deathmatch and just chase kills caring about nothing else. If you are queuing as a group with people you know or climb to higher ranks it probably gets better.

Pubstomp champions that can be lethally effective with minimal skill are the bane of overwatch solo queue. Torb, Symmetra, Junkrat, and to a lesser extent Hanzo when played as spamzo.

Turtle setups with Torb and Orissa or Bastion and Rein require very little skill to coordinate but to counter them you need your entire team working together. People say Blizzard doesn't balance the game around quickplay or bronze and silver but then why did the Roadhog nerfs happen? 
I don't understand why your opponent's keyboards don't have an "H" button on them. Most of mine have one right between "G" and "J."

Edit: maybe it's a problem on console?
Problem I've found with Zarya is you definitely win the first 3 seconds of an initiate, what with getting 80 charge between you and your teammates, but he'll keep spamming after your bubble is long gone and he's only got 400 health to chunk through minus the Orisa he's standing behind minus the Reaper trying to kill you anyway.

I would make the definitive argument he actually counters Zarya just by doing so much raw DPS that he can charge you and kill you in one foul swoop, and charge isn't worth anything when you're dead.

I've had the best luck with Winston because I can make him uncomfortable. He's only got 200 health and can't mine away or I'll follow him. I just can't get trapped.
Huge thing to learn as Junkrat is that to deal with a Winston, place a Mine at his feet. It will launch him backwards, away from whatever target he wanted. 
If you practice it enough, you can put the trap exactly where the winston falls. Is one of the most satisfying things to do XD

And even if he botters for like 5 seconds, he will be dead soon enough without making any real damage to the team, usually he will give just to much ult charge for the enemy in a case like this

(The same happens when winston tries to dive an Bastion team or an team with armor packs from torbjörn)
Thank you friend, trying to improve my english <3
I never had problems with widows to be honest, I think this will come to player skill and awareness

Since Junk can shot the place where widow hides without being on line of sight, but widow can easily one shot him, since most junks stay still or repeating the same movement pattern while spamming bombs
> bastion has to set up in turret mode to be effective

This is a myth. Recon has the same range as Soldier, with less spread. With its armor and less bursty healing, Bastion fares far better against grenade splash damage than most non-tanks. Sentry mode also easily melts a flying incoming Junkrat in less than half a second, in case you get divebombed.
I meant bastion is a bigger concern than junkrat with dva nerf unless she can kill him solo
Why should he have a chance against his biggest counters? (and I'll disagree about Soldier. That's completely map-dependent)

Lots of characters get destroyed by others such that they rely on teammates to synergize, why no Junkrat?
I'm sick of Blizzard "fixing" characters and eliminating their counter.

There are enough heroes in the game that yes, everyone *should* have a counter.  If you're playing junk rat and getting creamed by pharah, switch off junkrat.

Why the hell should a ground-based grenade lobber stand any chance against an aerial rocket shooter?

I give it two years before no one counters anyone, because Blizzard didn't want things to be unfair.
Concussion mine only does 120 dmg so it won't be one shotting anyone. If you mean the land one left click then concussion mine, then with that logic your trap is a one shot too
It doesn't matter if Bastion needs to see you to shoot you. If you do not deal with Bastion first, then you're not going to win a team fight and the same applies to Junkrat, but to a lesser degree.

Then why fight in small rooms? For examples, on Kings Row control point, the library on the left of the statue (from attackers PoV) is the best place for a defensive Junkrat to situate himself. Once he goes into the open, then he's at risk of dying. If you go up the opera house and drop down through the window and attack from the right side of the statue, you not only avoid the Junkrat spam, but you also are forcing the Junkrat to come out into the open.

When you approach a choke, you shouldn't be coming at an angle where your Reinhardt shield can be worn down or you are at risk of getting picked off/poked. With the changes that Junkrat has undergone, it's forcing you to play differently than before and thinking twice about the route you take to engage (doesn't work with all maps like Hanamura/Volskaya).
I mean, if Junkrat is in a small room, don't go into the small room.  There are no objectives that require you to be in a small room to contest them.

I learned from Chateau Deathmatch: don't go into the basement.  If Junkrat wants to kill me he can fight on my terms.
you wanna get through as fast as possible and dont stay outside, otherwise you will get hit by random spam. just get a lucio and dva/rein, i dont see how that can fail. its a few seconds where you have to pass it.
With hog, you can break down any barriers that a Junkrat can potentially hide behind faster than any other dps character.
I agree that rein gets shit on by junk now more than ever. The key with hog is to hook a rat into your team and allow your frontline to cleanup. Hog is also decent at killing tires quickly with his alt fire if your aim is good; his alt fire can one shot a tire at the correct distance. 

I think Pharah is the hardest counter to a junkrat, but I feel Orisa+hog+zarya is the best frontline to deal with him. 
Uhh, no. Pharah is a great counter to trob. Most spots she can position herself outside of the range of the turret and kill it for free. Setup shields on gas station Route 66? One boop destroys that strat every time.
Nice try Pharah
Dude pharaoh counters torb lol
Neato burrito!
Yeah not like he can instantly kill them both with 2 mines. 
Seconded, hog makes me sweat as junkrat. I can take him on if I catch him in a bad spot, but I really rather not.
Yea, I dont actually think JR is *that* OP. I do think he can throw out a lot of spam damage that is annoying considering thats the nature of spam; I dont like Demomen either when all the do is sit on a ledge and spam blindly down a hallway n manage to get 6 kills, but Im cognizant enough to know thats more an issue with ym own team not rotating and a Junkrat we're setting up to not have to work very hard. Its the nature of trash damage/spam damage classes. They serve to give Scouts/Tracers/Flankers an easier time in confirming kills. My only real beef with balancing situation was that they didnt... nudge down the damage of his concussion mine by like 15-20 damage.

However, I can definitely see a seasonal reign of defense heavy teams because we have a lot of heroes at the MOMENT that are simply very good at denying area from way far behind the choke and the games main damage mitigation machine is currently being "reworked". With everything being up in the air right now with no idea of where it might land yet, its gonna take people a lil' extra time to start forming new strategies when it comes to dealing with it. Its simply because we dont know where DVas gonna be in a few months and she might not be able to be the spear head, deleting choke spam in a the future, but she might also still be able to? The in unknown factor is probably making people insecure about future metas.
> one foul swoop 

One fell swoop.
Yeah, but hypothetically he can kill her in 2 seconds now.
If you're mostly playing bastion in sentry form than you'd probably be better off just playing solider. 
> Why should he have a chance against his biggest counters?

Because he was so hardly countered by so many heroes in the game that he was not even played on higher ranks, and the devs want to make an game where every hero have his place

> Lots of characters get destroyed by others such that they rely on teammates to synergize, why no Junkrat?

Lots ≠ All

Junkrat works like every other hero and will work at some points, at some situations, have his easy targets and have the ones who will destroy him.


______

Don't forget that junkrat was abandoned after season 1 just because he didn't stand a chance against the Death Balls with

Reinhardt + Zarya + Soldier + Pharah + Mercy + Lúcio

And remmember as well that if you look at the red glowing balls that he trows on you, they're coming slowly, you can move and avoid them without much work. Everybody was used to do this a year ago...

People are just trying to dive the junkrat and dying because they're dumb and don't respect the fact that he is an hero made to control an specific area of an map. Like every other Defensive hero...
Hard counters are in general bad for the game, because there's not really an amount of play that can fix the interaction. Ideally, the game will feature characters you choose having large advantages against other people, but skill should be able to overcome hard counters. Widow vs Winston comes to mind as an appropriate hard counter situation.
>  stand any chance 

By stand any chance it means that he will win like 5% of the combats against a Pharah

And any player that have at least 10 hours in the game will know that if you get bellow 120 HP, you don't get close to a junkrat XD Pharah only needs to use an Shift and done, zero chances again...
Would that not in itself be fair?
ICHTPT, and also what mawbles said.
lol whatever. It's not a "one shot". It's just "instantaneous". Takes a bit of coordination, but if they're in your face, there's a chance it happens before you can react if you're out of position.
Places I've had problems are 1. First point on Anubis 2. The choke on Eichenwald. Both seem doable, but in solo queue, when nobody seems to know the difference between "go right" and "go left", and people don't see to be able to coordinate... it's just sort of crazy.

For example, in the game I was talking about, people wanted to go into the right room on Eichenwald. They died doing that, and I said over comms "let's not go that way". Then they tried going main, and they were hit with spam and turrets. I don't know how people forget that the turrets are there... but they do.

So I know I should have gone DVA to eat spam, but there are situations where Junkrat is OP. I already "change my thinking", but it sounds like the counter to a Junkrat is a Pharah mercy. Force them to go Widow/Soldier/McCree, then jump on them.
True... but that whole time you are eating spam. I don't think junkrat is countered by hog. It only solves half of the problem. 
Hog is bad against junk man

The only tanks that do good against him are Reinhardt and Zarya

RoadHog = no self protection and extremely big hit box, junkrat can really aim and hit him on purpose

Orisa = Shield is fixed on a point, to big and easy to hit like rog

D.Va = Best at now, I don't know how it will be after changes, maybe she will be able to fly and deal with him by herself, maybe she will be weak, I have no idea.

Reinhart = Shield is big, 2000 HP, can move fast enough to get your entire team in the enemy face with the help of an Lúcio

Zarya = Will deal more damage than most DPS heroes all game thanks to an junkrat spaming

Junkrat went into oblivion after season 1 because comps where made by Reinhardt + Zarya + Mercy + Lúcio + Soldier + Pharah and with a good reason, everyone on the list is good against him
Thats because that is not a good place to setup.
Pharah can Long range that, One Lucio Boop and it's gone. Junk spam and DELETED.
It's a rank thing. Most Pharahs I see in gold / plat have no clue how to deal with a shielded turret. Heck, some even manage to get countered by the turret alone >.<
I play in Masters on console. I go Orisa/Torb/Soldier. This combo definitely counters Pharah. Even Pharmercy is not a problem. 

Torb's turret behind shield. Turret always tells where the Pharah is so no stealth movement. Soldier/Turret can shoot at Phara from 2 different angles and protect each other. This is a tough thing to break and requires dedicated push with good comms


No she doesn't, Turret deals 14 dmg per shot. A simple lvl 2 turrets fires 4 shots per second. 4x14=56. 3 secs + 1 hot by torbs gun and she is OUT. 
only the best of friends know each others weaknesses
Yeah, I definitely think JR's mine should have been nerfed a little to compensate for his having two now. The way they worded it was that it would help his mobility--and it does. But it also makes him be able to burst HUGE amounts of damage in a very short amount of time.

The meta is going to be in turmoil for the next couple weeks with the DVa and Mercy change incoming. No way to know how the dust will settle. 

I've always liked Junkrat, but I've never played him much in competitive simply because of his marginal ineffectiveness in the previous metas. I'm happy to see him more prominent, but, yeah, *this* prominent? lol
What's to say his swoop isn't just foul? ;D
If you're mostly playing bastion in sentry form you'd probably be better off just playing torbjorn.
Those are the two most Junk favored chokes in the game (Rogue played him on Anubis ages ago before tank meta)...  If he didn't give you trouble there he'd be useless.
Sounds like in those situations you would have lost to a Bastion even.
You underestimate Orisa. I've been twisting junkrats nuts off as her these past few days.  Junkrats will try to spam your shield, you halt him, melt him and move on.   Granted this requires your team lay some pressure on possible shields but Orisa is goodt for that too. 
Yes it is. At low rank any hero can kill any hero it's a toss up. Not truly a matter of "counters"
Ugh, 3 characters versus 1 or 3 v2 yeah it should win...
Well duh a soldier lol. I play GM on xbone. And yes at that point you're making pharah job harder by applying pressure with soldier and a shield with Orissa but you could do that with anyone who counters someone. Like reaper counters Winston but if you add DVA and mcree then no he couldn't do so well. But overall, torb is very countered by pharah. Yes you can build a comp it make it more viable but that's more complex than his discussion 
..... she can literally fire one of the most high dps projectiles at it from a distance the turret can't reach and shoot it down like it's nothing lol....

Edit: not to mention torb has to practically stand still to build a turret making him very easily killed by such a high damage projectile hero such as pharah. 
Torb is useless without his turret and there isn't anyone better at taking it out than pharah. 
Honestly Id be happy if a Junkrat couldnt bust me down as a Zarya with full health lol

But I dont think the mine should be useless. I wouldve been happy with simply decreasing it from 120 to 100.
Maybe, but I feel like people understand how to counter Bastion. We're at the point where junkrat is new, and people don't get it.
It's true, an Orisa shield cooldown is a lot harder to race as a junk than any other shield tank
I'm not underestimating Orisa, I'm taking in consideration equal skills Orisa and Junkrat players.

Junkrat is an hard counter to Orisa, not because he will spam the shield, because he will surpass the shield and hit her without even being on line of sight.

The reason for you to be destroying so many junks on Orisa is simple, they're bad, most junk players are pretty bad man.

Is just because he is an "new" thing and people aren't ready to deal with it yet.


For example, are you still scared of an PharMercy as you was on Season 4? Or Scared of an Reaper as you was when he got the healing buff? Or is still to hard to hit the doomfist trying to combo you? Everything gets easier after you get used to it
main junkrat and I agree. have no problem walking right up to rein while shooting and the lobbing a mine over to boop him up in the air. not scared on rein at all.

Orissa on the other hand by the time I wear the shield down if no one else is attacking her shield she can put another one up almost immediately, all while shooting at me. if she's half health I'll mine over her shield and blast her assuming fortify is on cd. she's only easy if she's backed up against a wall you can bounce your grenades off onto her
I am just saying that Pharah counters Torb argument is not valid if your teammates are helping the turret stay up. 

I am pointing out that in this scenario Pharah would have to depend on her teammates to take care of the turret and hence Torb is countering her and not the other way around.
> but you could do that with anyone who counters someone

Agreed. And as you said counters are a much more complicated discussion and depend on the comp more than individual 1v1 matchups. 
If you are having too many 1v1's you are playing the game wrong  

When someone says Pharah counters Torb I do not agree because when we are having trouble on defense from a pharah I request team to go torb+hitscan+shield with successful results. 
That's why position is key, or... Does hog counter soldier? On plain paper yeah, put a Soldier on high ground and hog is out. SAME THING. 
If you have a bad torb on plain sight yeah it is. Positioning is key.
Me too... I'm thinking (hoping) that blizzard will eventually make this change lol
lol you're one of those people who will stop at nothing to defend an argument. So no point in discussing it further. Soldier counters pharah. So arguing that including one of her hardest counters in addition to an op shield to protect the torb doesn't really make sense. At the end of the day pharah can play out of LOS and distance to displace torb and destroy his turret and also limit his ability to properly place is turret in the ideal location making him unviable. Anyone in GM+ that I've met agrees pharah counters torb. And if the team has dedicate over half their team comp (3 people) just to manage a torb the pharah is doing more than countering torb she's dictating the entire enemy play style 

Edit: if you have to dedicate 2 addition heros to protecting the torb I think it's a no brainer that he's getting hard countered lol 

Edit 2: just out of curiosity, who do you think torb's hard counters are? Cuz if not pharah I'm interested in who else is better?
Does Torb counter Pharah? On paper, yes, but if Pharah fires a rocket from around a corner and repeats this, Torb is out. 
That's not how any of this works, I'm afraid. 
Not the same thing at all. 
Yes position is key, and pharah will negate his turret anywhere it's useful. If he has to hide is turret so much then torb is useless cuz his turret has no LOS. 99% of the time this is true. Always exceptions exist 
> lol you're one of those people who will stop at nothing to defend an argument

No I am not just trying to win the argument. I just saying that there are alternatives and saying one player counters others while totally discounting team synergy is unfair and brings out the wrong impression. 

>Edit: if you have to dedicate 2 addition heros to protecting the torb I think it's a no brainer that he's getting hard countered lol

Torb is not just taking care of Pharah he is also taking care of other potential flankers and providing armor to healers.   

> Edit 2: just out of curiosity, who do you think torb's hard counters are? Cuz if not pharah I'm interested in who else is better?

A good dive Winston+Dva or Zarya, 2 out of Genji, Tracer, Sombra, Pharah any two healers - preferably lucio/mercy. But even at my masters elo teamwork is really a hit or miss. 

Yes I did include Pharah in the dive comp because there she will be effective. But Pharah in a deathball comp will not be effective vs Shield+Torb+hitscan. 

Rocket in the face? Yeah it does.
Then how is it? Please enlighten me.
Yes they do exist.
You do know that tracer is like super hard countered by torb right? Her blink means nothing to an auto aim target and she has 150hp. And I'm not talking comps. I'm talking single heros who hard counter him
Ideally, the Torb would position it well and not die with his turret so he could rebuild.
Because there is no positioning anywhere in this game where Tjorb turret can counter Pharah. Anyone decent will tell you this. This isn't a simple case of "high-ground/low ground" - Pharah can literally either hit the turret out of range or do kite missles from around a wall. If they shield it that means the shield isn't protecting the choke. Seriously I just don't think you have much experience or you're talking out of your ass. 

Zen VOD for review
Stuck in high silver, low gold. Here's a game from today. Help me out. I usually QP with my friends who are diamond and hold my own just fine. Is it just bad luck?

https://youtu.be/xD5g2anx744Hi, diamond zen main here. I watched 3 minutes (don't have much time atm). You always want to position yourself on the back as zen, keep your distance, have cover and have vision on your team (in the general case, off-course there are exceptions), because you could basically use everything of your kit from there. I noticed you doing this wrong at 0:25 (You are at the front line of the attack), 1:25 (You could shoot from the far back, no need to be in Soldiers face), 1:50 (You say group up, but still go alone on the front line and get picked. You needed to stay far back and indeed regroup and wait for the team), 2:30 (You have perfect cover behind the wall - use it, shoot from there and assist the team, you could also ult there in order to cap the point for sure. Instead you go in the middle of the point and get picked). Another important thing is to always have both of your orbs active. If you watch through the first minutes, you will notice many moments, where that is not the case and the reason I think is that you are in front of the team instead of behind it.

There are other errors too, but I think you should try to fix one thing at a time, don't focus on too many stuff and you will notice an improvement over time.


Two things stand out to me after watching the whole video: 

One: You should think about investing in a mic so that you can call out your discords. This will make it easier for your teammates to collapse on a target. 

Plus, it's just generally good to have a mic for communication, even if you're the only one who has one because you can still call out to your teammates if there is a flanker on you in the backline. 

Two: You have this habit of shooting directly at an enemy instead of shooting where they will be. This causes you to miss some of your shots because you aren't accounting for their travel time.

You have to get into the habit of leading your targets. This can be difficult to do. So I advise that you start out by going to the practice range and firing at the moving bots from all sorts of ranges as well as doing it on the move, because you're almost always going to be moving and shooting. 

Hope this advice helps. 
Full disclosure, low Plat high gold Zen main.

I find that I have to go to front line to get picks when my dps fails to, even if it means I die and the fight is 5v5 or 5v4. This happens even when I've called out a discord target (like an isolated soldier near the front for example) and nobody kills him. My aim isn't anything amazing at longer ranges and getting up close often throws off opponents.

I'm curious as to your opinion on this.
Hey, sorry, swore I posted a reply to this, but I think the app jacked it up. I started a little rough on this one, but got better. I get that I do come up close on this one, but it was because I was trying to get the discord on the enemy so I could have both my abilities active, with the choke being around the corner at the first point, its hard to stay too far back and still get the discord if they aren't coming in because of the Roadhog was holding them back.
As far as the group up message, it doesn't happen in this particular game, because I didn't stay and actually try to group up, but 9/10 times at this low a level, I'll stay in the spawn, spaming group up, and they will still just go off on their own, and with all DPS, its hard to get a push with all 6 of us when not even two will stay back to group up. I agree completely, and better coordination could be had if I used my mic, but like I posted in the comments below, majority of people in the country I am in don't use a mic, or speak different languages. 
Thanks for the tips, and let me know if you watch the rest, I'd really appreciate it.
I do have a mic, problem is right now I am deployed, and in a country where most of the people I play with don't speak English. Beginning of every game I ask if anyone has one, and I always get nothing. 

As for aim, I feel it comes and goes, but I'm usually pretty decent at it. I am on PS4, so no KB/mouse to be that much better at. But I still will go practice some more. Thanks
I'd say it's probably not worth it. Sometimes you'll get the pick and escape, sometimes you'll trade, sometimes you'll just die. IMO the higher you get in rank, the more people will punish a Zen randomly front-lining with the tanks. Somebody will see you and callout, "Focus this Zen," and you'll get burst down almost immediately for being out of position.
I agree with Brodo00095 on this one. You don't have much reason to do this and also in most cases you could achieve the same from distance when your aim gets better. An exception are some KOTH maps, where the majority of the fights are close distance. I'd say the rule of thumb should be - if you have to decide between keeping your dps alive and killing an enemy, always keep the dps alive first and then go for the kill.
No problem man :) I was in silver too and I know what you mean, it's impossible to group six people. Just try to wait for the tanks or if there are none, wait for as many teammates as possible. Also if you find yourself doing nothing, you could always charge and spam a right click (it could be canceled with melee btw if you dont want to expose your position). Cheers!
That's a fair point. I'll definitely see how playing in the back the next few games goes.
> I'd say the rule of thumb should be - if you have to decide between keeping your dps alive and killing an enemy, always keep the dps alive first and then go for the kill.

/u/erindalc 

Also a mid-diamond Zen main. I wouldn't necessarily agree with this, I think it depends on the situation. If you're on offense and are at the start of the map or have just capped a checkpoint, it's in your favor to trade because you have spawn advantage. If you're at the second point on 2CP, or are making the final push for point C of a payload, then it's in the team's best interest to keep everyone alive.

Vice versa applies for defense. You don't want to trade early in maps/checkpoints, but if you're holding point C or the second point of 2CP, a trade is generally in your favor.
Thank you.
Yeah that makes sense.

That's something I need to keep in mind gamesense wise is spawn advantage.
You are absolutely right :) I didn't want to get in such detail as it is hard to improve one thing when focusing on too many stuff. Thanks for bringing the detailed picture too.
No problem, at least someone here says 'thank you', even though not the author :)
Raisolution, do you have any vids of your Zen play I could watch?

Are there any really good/comprehensive guides for beginners?
Hi there. I'm really sorry if this is clearly available somewhere. I've checked the resources/guides page on this sub and others and have done my own search, but I am unable to find something that really starts at the beginning and spills everything. I am terrible. 

I'm level 16, and I constantly die without having any impact on the game. I just run around confused until someone kills me. So I'm looking for some in-depth beginner's guide or something. Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you all so much!!

&nbsp;

P.S. Would anyone like to play with me?Ok before expecting to become barely decent, I 'd say there's 4 things you need to really get into :

First, go in training range and test every single hero. Not just 1 minuts but until you see what every button can do and understand what makes the hero special. You need to do it until you even know all the sounds the hero makes when he's firing /  ulting and what is the effect.

Why? because that way you will know what's coming to you in real game. You will recognize the sounds and visal effects of specific hero. You will know when or where they are dangerous and how you should react, like running away from a reaper in close range or hide from a widow on hight ground. 


Two : You need to play on every single map several times. You need to know the basic path, the side roads, the chock points, the spots to hide and the danger zone. If you get lost, separated from your team, constantly suprised by a flanker, you will die ALL THE TIME.


Three : Truely understand the rules. It sounds pretty basic but OW is not a "frag fest". You cannot survive if you don't understand why people is acting the way they do. Positioning and overall survival is easier when you know what's happening.

Four : Play, play, play. Only way to get better is to play.
In my opinion it will come with time as you get to learn the game, heroes's abilities, etc (I don't know how much you know about this). I am also sure there must be videos on Youtube and guides on Google to help you out. I am not a really good player myself but if you want I could play with you and try to help you a bit, at least as much as I can. 
Honestly, practicing is the best way to improve. Make sure you know how the points/overtime work (always get on during overtime!), stick with your team as you'll almost always die if outnumbered, and look up how to play some specific heroes. And try out some different ones and find ones that fit the way you like to play the most. Also, look at the killfeed and think about what you could have done to avoid dying but don't beat yourself up about it. I think it's best not to overthink it this early on as it's really easy to learn a bunch of information that isn't as important as these basics. Please feel free to ask us if you have any specific questions too!! Good luck, you got this.
I remember being totally overwhelmed when I started, I think some of the first things to focus on are just learning to stick with teammates or run away when outnumbered and figuring out the maps. Create a custom game for yourself and and explore the maps, you can choose which one or just get a random one. Play 3v3 in arcade a little on the side to work on using your abilities without being overwhelmed. 

Don't sweat it too much that you feel ineffective right now, OW is very simple on the surface but has a lot of depth. 
There is an arcade mode called mystery heroes. It helped me when I was still pretty new to the game because it "forced" me to play different heroes I was previously scared/disinterested about playing. And a lot of people don't take it seriously because they know people are playing heroes they're weak on/know nothing about. Just hit F1 to see your hero's abilities.
Go to "Your Overwatch" YouTube channel. They're great for beginner and intermediate level knowledge. After that u want to move on from them (this sub loves hating on them). But before then, they're absolutely phenomenal. This game is hard to learn, I highly recommend them. Just go to their archive and watch vids 
Here's the briefest possible guide. 1. You need to have mechanical skills that are reasonably appropriate for your rank 2. You need to make good decisions. 

The second point is more important. In Bronze rank you'll occasionally find players who have good enough mechanics to succeed in Plat or Diamond. Bronze generally isn't the place for players with bad mechanics. Bronze is for people who consistently make bad decisions. 


Here's the simple guide to making good decisions. Fight as a team. Focus targets as a team. If you're outnumbered, don't fight. If you don't know if you're outnumbered then you need to get better at counting. 

The bulk of the challenge in lower levels is getting people to work together, and getting people to stop making bad decisions.
Wow, thank you all so much!!
Also, if you didn't know this already, under the play section, you can go to game browser (the panel on the far right) and then click create at the top right. This will let you create a custom game on any map. You can start the game with just you (make sure you set it to invite or friends only so random strangers can't join). Then you can run around the maps freely for as long as you want (I think the game might time you out after 30 minutes). When I first started out, I spent literally about two weeks just loading up different maps and poking my nose into all the nooks and crannies. I probably spent 2-3 hours on each map this way before I finally felt even somewhat comfortable on them in actual games. You can also add in AI bots in custom games to practice your aim, or practice different hero abilities and stuff like that. There's actually a ton of settings you can adjust in custom matches (even down to hero specific adjustments) for some really cool ways to practice aim and other things. You don't need to get this complex early on, but custom games are you best friend when trying to test things out or just get more familiar with the game.

Also, try playing some matches vs the AIs (under the practice, or play-->vs AI). Start with easy or medium (hard bots have aim bot and wall hacks and are really difficult even for experienced players). These are pretty low key matches, and you can work on just getting used to how the heroes you want to play move and the abilities they have. 
Are you on PC or console? I will play Quick Play with you or the games against AI if you are on PS4 (NA).

This is my first FPS (and only the third game I've ever played in my life), so when I started a couple months ago, I was probably in a worse position than you. A few tips:

1. If you're on PS4, then don't be discouraged about dying really quickly in Quick Play because there are just a ton of "smurfs" because apparently, anyone can make a new account fairly easily. Just keep playing because eventually it won't even matter because most of the "smurfs" aren't high level anyway.

2. The first thing I did was go into the practice range and fire off each ability on each character. This taught me a bit about who I'd be fighting against, and it gave me a good idea of who to try playing first. 

3. Next, I went into the games against AI and played there. You can create a custom arcade game where you're the only real person, and everyone on both teams are bots. That way, it won't even matter how good or bad you do because it's just practice that affects no one. I only did this until I was mechanically proficient, and by that, I mean that I could hit all the buttons when I wanted to do something without having to think about which button to hit. The added benefit is that you won't get XP if there are no real players, which means you won't rank up, and when you start playing with real people, they'll know you're new based on your low level.

After that, just practice in Quick Play. 

Another thing I did was to load up maps in custom arcade games so that I could learn the maps and flank routes. Once you know the flank routes, you'll know where to watch for flankers, which helps keep you from dying more than anything... always be looking everywhere. Shoot, look around, shoot, look around, shoot, rinse, repeat.
Hey, I'd love to play with you. My bnet name is Aaron#11779. Thanks for the tips!
When I play healers, I feel like I have a hard time figuring out who to prioritize, especially with someone like Zenyatta. I think the hero has a really fun kit, but I have no clue how to use it. There's always so much going on, and it's hard to tell who even has my orb, who's low, if I should be shooting or finding targets for my orbs, etc... hahaha. It's such a busy game! Thanks for the tips!

Also concerning Zenyatta...I can't seem to hit anyone consistently with him. His orbs travel so slowly, but if I get too close to targets I feel like I die faster than them. haha
> this sub loves hating on them

For a good reason tho. Their meta predictions are often wrong. For example they thought Roadhog rework would make him better in dive meta yet it made him worse across the board. They thought Reaper Lifesteal buff wouldn't be enough yet he's a lot better now, and for a long time they thought Mccree was balanced yet he was one of the weakest heroes in the game at that time. 

Next up are their hero guides. Typically they are 10-15 min long, but after watching them I learn absolutely NOTHING. Now compare that to excellent hero guides by for example [Level 5 Pidgey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0IfcOecR7I&t=1s) or [Iostux](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBPCmP5El1BqpItqCswvMkw). In contrast to just talking over some random footage in the background, these guys actually spend effort making their guides and go over all the small details you need to know for that particular hero.

I wouldn't say Your Overwatch is as bad as people make it out to be, but why spend time watching a mediocre YT channel while you can  watch something better? Here are some of my recommendations:

I already mentioned [Iostux](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBPCmP5El1BqpItqCswvMkw) earlier, but his channel is pretty much the golden grail of educational OW. Unfortunately some of his videos have clickbaity titles, but still the content is really good.

[Skyline](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDrfc_LU0llSRI7icBFoBnw) is again another good educational YTer, but the quality suffers a bit due to him stretching some of his videos to 10+ min for that ad revenue.

[KarQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQH4V9PiY_eLo4Ihr1tWCwQ) focusses mainly on support, but he also has good general guides out there.

[Overwatchdojo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYbJ6SGufekKMgzt42Dr1RQ) is just good, not much to say there.

Last but not least, [Terioth](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUvMcrN3P2gfYpfwR6xivgA) makes helpful 2-3 min videos for EACH hero sharing 5 tips per video (some if not all heroes have multiple videos).


Oh, the other thing I would add is that Coach Seksi has really great videos that explain positioning once you get to the point that you're ready for that. I'd recommend watching those as soon as you are mechanically halfway decent.
Alright, I'll add you when I can, hope I'll be able to help ^^
No problem! With Zenyatta, I don't play him too much but I can give you some pointers. I tend to use the harmony orb on whoever has the least health/is in danger, and discord on whoever the team is already engaging with to make them die faster. I say that because ideally your teammates will target who you put the orb on, but that doesn't always happen at lower levels/ranks. If you call out who you've discorded that could help with that tho. As for his aim, one tip is you might want to charge up the shot as an enemy rounds a corner, releasing when they come into sight. If you practice you'll be quite deadly as he can do a lot of damage. And definitley try to keep your distance, let the enemies be focused on your teammates.

As for keeping track of what's happening, the status of your teammates, and what you should be doing in a given moment, that will improve across all heroes in time. I felt the same way when I started, everything happens so fast! But you get used to it. 
Among those, Skyline is my favorite. I hear u man. That being said, I still believe (and am genuinely awaiting your argument) that Your Overwatch is the most beginner friendly, approachable, and practical place to go first. Have you ever taught someone something? I seriously don't mean that aggressively, I'm genuinely wondering. I'm an MD, have taught, and have spent so much time in educational settings, and I'm in Masters (in OW, not the degree lol). I've watched all those guys and you're totally right, they're significantly better than Your Overwatch. But IMO not for a complete beginner. Iostux's charisma is on the level of Ben Stein (iostux if u see this, you're the man, don't mean this as an insult) and I seriously can't imagine learning the basics of the game from him. Maybe some could, but does that seem fun or engaging? Idk. Like I said, you're right, those guys are better, but IMO/experience your overwatch is a better place to start as an absolute beginner and ease your way into things. I think the other channels aren't very good at teaching beginners, other than Skyline who IMO is best all-around. Like at the end of the day, when a beginner is learning, the material is not that complicated, so the most engaging/approachable channel wins out, just from a logical standpoint. It's actually comical how much "experienced" players like to dissuade noobs from watching a channel that's literally designed to help noobs learn the very basics of the game. I'm not bothered by their meta predictions bc I don't rely on them for that...it seems that anyone that used them to learn reached a point in their natural progression of learning the game in which they realize YO no longer serves their purposes. Like, is it at all relevant if you learn something from watching their hero guides? No, lol.  OP is new to the game bro. Advanced positioning guides are going to hinder his progress if anything. But OP, just peep all of this guy's recommendations, and see which u like the most. Cheers though TharTV, I'm looking forward to your response. Do you think any of those guys are better for complete noobs? Do you not think those channels are a little offputting for ppl new to the game due to how advanced and straight up bland most of their videos/styles are?


Hey, thanks for all the tips. I'll check his videos out too! I am on PC. Wish they had cross platform!
I get where you are coming from though. Some people may like entertaining content like YO/Stylosa, but at the same time, I think many people (at least speaking for myself) are also interested in watching people that really know what they are talking about. 

You're probably right about Iostux, he's pretty lazy when it comes to his presentation (for example he just reads his slides word by word and his mic makes (or at least used to) a lot of unnecessary noise). I still however think that KarQ, Terioth and Overwatchdojo are informative yet still entertaining, and in case of the latter their presentation is actually really good. 

>Like, is it at all relevant if you learn something from watching their hero guides? 

The problem is that they call their guides "Advanced"  although they are not. Idk how to describe it, but if you watch any good guide like this [D.Va guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0IfcOecR7I&lc=z12bc5xp3yn2v303l22mf13z5tqssjosw.1498587490681349) by L5 Pidgey and compared it to your typical Advanced YO guide, the difference is quite apparent I think. 

After all their wrong meta predictions/hero assessments and after watching [this dissection video by Iostux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZBJv6bIvrk&t=2s), I can't help but be extremely skeptical about their content. 

One more thing. When you're in the practice range, go to the side where there's just a single bot just hanging out by itself. Test each character's weapon range. This will help you more than anything because you'll automatically know how far away you need to be from another character and how close your character needs to be. It will also help you figure out which fights to take on and when to retreat. For example, don't be the Zen taking on a reaper up close. Don't be the reaper shooting at Zen from 40m away. I see a lot of new players who don't bother to learn weapon range, and they see lots of eliminations in the stats, but they're just putting in a couple pellets while an ally actually confirms the kill.
I completely agree man, and you're right. Can also tell your game knowledge is high. Hit me up if u want to play lol Option#11208
Just like you I'm also in masters (at least with my highest acc, other one is in diamond) and play on EU servers (tried NA and it's really nice except for the unbearable lag issues atm). Will add you to FL later :)

Why is my aim great without warm up, then slowly gets worse the longer I play/warmup?
I have this weird issue, but when I just wake up in the morning, and jump straight into a game my aim is amazing, but after a few games it just slowly gets worse and worse to the point where its not worth playing. Same happens when i go on holiday for a few days, come back, my aim is the best its ever been, then slowly deteriorates.

If i start off with a warm up, same thing happens, at the start my aim is great, but slowly towards the end of the warm up, my aim is just bad.

Does anyone know why this is, and how I can fix it?I should note a difference between warm-up and training, because I feel this may help your situation. This may sound irrelevant but please bear with me, I think there's a catch here.

A training session includes activities which force you. These activities are hard and tiring if done for an extended period at once. Playing tryhard aim hero, Osu, trying to 1 clip all bots in the arena in less than 20 seconds with tracer, flawless headtracking while crouch and ADAD spam, headshotting all 6 different bots with 1 mcree clip in less than 5 seconds. These are somewhat difficult and if you do these for a long period of time, they will tire you and your aim will get worse at the end. If you queue right after a training session, your performance will suffer.

In contrast, a warm-up session should not be difficult. It must feel just like how you feel in a match. It should just help you get your rust off, get that coordination back real quick. A quickplay session, a deathmatch fun, some mystery heroes, an ana paintball session or fooling around in the training area. These are warm-up. These are not as tiresome as training. You can do these as long as your "gaming stamina", which is the energy that lets you keep playing in general, wears off. 

If you train, you need to rest afterwards. If you warm-up, you are ready to play. You do not hit the gym right before the marathon; you stretch and do a brief jog to get that blood flowing before the event. 

From the stuff you posted, it occurred to me that you may inadvertently be "training" instead of warming up.

Does that help you?
I have the same issue sometimes! It's the same for playing the guitar, btw ;D

Having read some books about behavioral psychology, I think it may have something to do with glucose levels in the brain maybe. I think it's a good idea to warm up until your aim gets bad (thats your true aim), to only play for a few straight hours and generally just rest and eat well.

Meaning maybe a nap at noon and lots of vegetables and no sugary stuff. That punches your blood sugar all over the place. If you want to really rock for a short time, it's great tho ;D

It's just speculation in the end, but fact is your food is having a ton of influence over your cognitive functions.
You need to take a break and relax, specifically your eyes.  In between games walk around or look out through a window or something and focus on something further away. 
Don't focus on your aim...  Focusing on your aim puts you in your head.  Focus on killing the enemy before they kill you or anyone on your team.  Adding those elements of urgency and importance gives you direction without pressure.  
Whats your sens? I think the more supple movement after warming up and the actual ingame stress might affect your ideal sens.

my 46cm/360 feels a bit too slow when warming up, but when warmed up if feels fine for the most part. Even so there are days where I feel just the tiniest bit too slow or too fast, and Ill just adjust my sens with 0.02 up or down to make up for that. 
Decision fatigue would be my guess.
You need a break. Your anxiety, stress, and brain are getting in the way of muscle memory. You're thinking too hard about doing well and you choke.


Go get a glass of water after warming up, maybe some fresh air. Come back relaxed.
That's like asking why you become slower after running for 3 hours.
relax your eyes, take a quick break between matches when you notice it. Stretch your fingers and wrists once in a while. It's just like anything else repetitive. It's very easy to fall into a rhythm when you're doing anything like that. Your eyes stop noticing smaller cues, your ears stop paying as much attention to secondary noises, etc. 

Taking a break every once in a while and taking your mind, fingers, ear, and eyes off of that focus even if it's just for 30 seconds will help.

Think about it like this. One of the reasons we are taught to "actively scan" when we're driving is to help prevent highway hypnosis. Even though you're looking ahead, you're awake, you're alert, and you're paying attention, if you steadily just watch the road and lines ahead of you you'll fall into a sort of "daze". 
Ever drove somewhere and then realize you don't remember the drive? When things become committed to muscle memory we tend to react instead of act because that muscle memory becomes our natural reactions. 

Try it out and I think you'll find it helps mitigate that. 
I'm like that, usually is because I try to win to hard. I get triggered by every mistake I see made by me and others in the game...

What I do in order to keep relaxed and still do great in the game:

1. After each match I do 10 Squats + 10 push ups + 10 pull ups while I wait for a match (I'm kinda crazy about exercising XD)

2. After 3 matches I go to my pet and play with her a while

3. If I lose 3 in a row, I do other things, probably I'll create an FFA map and call friends to enjoy some murdering <3
Same with me. Another thing that affects my aim is room temperature. Too cold and I switch off mcree for Winston. 
For me personally it's the same. Nerves always get me. Was doing great yesterday after a looong break in FFA deathmatch. Then I got to first place at 18 kills and I started being all jittery and I ended up 3rd with 18 kills because I couldn't hit shit. 
You are probably playing looser and freer when you start up.
As you play, you're getting more stressed and tight - which is worsening your play.  Chances are, you're taking past games into the next game and it is adversely impacting your performance.
Everyone has a differing optimal level of arousal (sports psychology). Athletes/competitors aim to mediate this level constantly to allow for optimal performance. You most likely function more effectively at the lower end of stress/arousal. Take a break eat a kit-kat!
You are probably starting out engaged and alert, then get mentally fatigued and switch to autopilot.

It's the same thing with any skill, if you can practice for more than 45-90 minutes at a time, you're not practicing hard enough.

When you notice your play deteriorating, stop and do something else for an hour or two. After fatigue you're just building bad habits.
It is REALLY hard to tell when you are losing focus and intensity. Try and consciously double down on it. Try a routine, e.g. every time you die (just because that happens consistently) - do something to remind yourself to stay present and focused. 

Most people just gradually lose focus and don't even notice. But if you're really "manually" forcing yourself to be focused, when you are done after a significant time playing you should REALLY feel it - you'll be exhausted. 
Fatigue
I have a similar issue, in my case it's because of strain problems in my right arm.  You simply need to take a break and stretch until your arm muscles relax. 
Don't know if this applies to you, but it helped me in a similar situation so I'll share. My issue is that as I continue playing, my motions become less concious and more on autopilot. I start aiming with my wrist instead of my arm and I become really inconsistent with my shots. What helps me is to focus on making each movement of my arm concious instead of automatic. Focusing on each deliberate action dramatically improves my aim.

Hope this helps you
Stamina is a thing.
Crap same exact thing happens to me. 
I feel this so hard I was playing Ana today and started to lose my flow.
I came back from a week long vacation and jumped right into a quick game with no warmup. I usually have a consistent routine consisting of Aim Hero drills and Training Ground drills. But without any of that I just ran around like a freaking pro slaughtering everyone with precision aim and was just baffled. Then the longer I played and more intense I got the worse my aim was. So just staying relaxed and calm and "uncaring" seems to be the best way. 
"I get tired when I work all day, what is wrong with me?"
as a junkrat main I'm sorry but I can't relate 
It's just you overthinking 
Take more breaks. Your brain, eyes, and reflexes will all deteriorate playing a bunch in a row. 


Late to the party, but hopefully this helps you anyway OP...

I don't think this is psychological as most people are suggesting. At least not entirely. I expect your muscles are just physically fatiguing. Not so much that you notice it, but a lot of the little muscles around your wrist and hand that are responsible for fine motor control can start to weaken without you feeling it.

It happens in golf as a classic example. A golfer with bad technique is relying on these stabilising muscles for their swing. It's fine at first, but these little muscles fatigue quickly and the swing deteriorates. Good golf technique minimises the use of these little guys, instead relying more on main muscle groups. They don't tire as easily so the swing stays strong.

As for fixing it, that's tricky. I know nothing about mouse 'technique'. Upping your sens might reduce movement required, but it might be the really small accurate movements that are tiring you. So perhaps lowering sens and trying to rely more on elbow could work. Either way - experimenting with different techniques could help, but taking frequent breaks to let your hand recover definitely will.
Complacency 
> I should note a difference between warm-up and training

This a really good and important distinction, thanks for bringing it up. I feel it's best to "train" as a session all itself without competitive play after.
mind blown!  great clarification.
Seems very plausible, although I don't think you should be all too worn out after half an hour already, even when training. If it's wholly about exhaustion there should be about 1-2 hours of playing involved at least (imo). So I think raw physical constitution of the player is one factor here.
I noticed this during the crux of my undergrad degree. what i ate for breakfast had huge impacts on how well i could do homework. trying to eat right is hard though :(
I think your 0.02 is so small it's almost impossible to perceive.

funny enough I think you may have some point because it might be a nice placebo effect. 

Fun fact, the placebo effect still works even if you know that it's a placebo. 
fantastic. 2 downvotes for this guy, but "relax your eyes" gets a thumbs up. Overwatch University...  
Honestly from what I've read on here you're better off looking in the CS:GO community for your aim tips. The most likely reason this is happening is that your sens is too high and you have to strain yourself to aim. This should never happen if you stay relaxed.
Exactly this in my opinion, my go-to is warming up, heading outside to smoke some herb and chill, then hitting the ranked grind hard. 

Edit: Just finished up the routine again, can confirm it's an effective strategy. 
Second the water. Food too if you're not eating and skip a meal. You're body has physical needs even if you're sitting in a chair.
Lol, I'll try beering up now before games xD
People really forget about amazing it is to smoke outside opposed to inside. Getting that fresh air combined with a fresh high is 10x better imo 
Cold hands is my bane too.
It depends on what your in game sense is already. If it's at 10, probably not. Mine is at 1.15 and I can notice a difference each time I lower my sense by .02
Man I play so bad when I'm high. Props to you for pulling it off
dude WEED
I miss smoking outside :( I just moved into a new apartment, and there's nowhere to do it safely. I used to go lay in my hammock by the creek in my backyard and just smoke and chill for forever.

But living alone makes it worth it, I guess. It's nice not having roommates.
Dudeeee, thats my thing lol.
Absolutely man, add a craft beer into the mix and you're off to the races
Fck air conditioning. :(
0.02 / 1.15 x 100 = 1.739%

you can feel ~1.74% difference? that's quite impressive. 

what is your dpi? 

lets just assume your DPI is 3000 

1.15 sens,  3000 dpi = 40.158 cm/360 

1.13 , 3k dpi = 40.869 cm/360 

so you can feel 0.711 cm  difference in a 360? you could be a brain surgeon. 

assume 2k dpi and your difference in ~1.1cm /360. 

I seriously doubt what you're saying. 


I've got 2000+ hours of playing CS while toasted, I guess practice makes perfect haha
For a lot of people it helps them focus
My first few games are better high. Then about game 4 or 5 I get significantly worse. It helps to play heros that require minimal aim, like Winston. I play a pretty mean high Junkrat too.
Weed just adds to my anxiety. I would play 10x worse if I smoked before playing. 
LMAO
Vaping has significantly less smell, and the "smoke" clears away much faster.
You should be able to get away with vaping on your deck or even inside if you prefer.
Get an apartment with a big terrace, I have a great view over the city, two lean back chairs and a 32m2 space for all my desalting needs. 
No wonder half my team is always high with you two smoking it up every game. Lol.

Except for with me, the times when I get people who have burned before a match seem to have repeated the "heading outside to smoke some herb and chill" step more than once or twice...
Hell yeah bruh, look forward to that shit everyday. 
Brain surgeon? Seriously! you belittle me by assuming I can't do basic math, or realize it would be less than 2 percent? 

Believe what you'd like, but I'm not going to waste any more my breath in reply to such a disdainful comment. 
It's called context-dependent memory. If you learned something while in a certain condition or place, it's actually easier to recall when you are in the same context. In this case, being high might just make you a better player because all that practice is easier to recall.
weed withdrawl sucks
Yeah I tend to overfocus, like tunnel vision style. Totally wrecks my game sense.
The comedown is when you get drowsiest.
Oh I can get away with smoking inside, which is what I do. It's fine, I just miss the chilling outside in a hammock getting high, it was super relaxing.

And I could probably get away with vaping on my deck, but I've already been arrested once several years ago and it just seems like a risk not worth taking to me (it doesn't help that I share a deck with neighbors).
That's in the works, but I'd need to get a raise or two first (or a second job). Living on your own on $12 an hour is kinda difficult. It's sad that that's almost double minimum wage and I still struggle to make ends meet some months.
Lol i feel like it helps me focus, obvi it keeps me calm, i usually try to make my team laugh and shit, my aim is usually a little better when im faded too. I usually try to fit a FFA match inbetween every comp game aswell!
>seem to have repeated the "heading outside to smoke some herb and chill" step more than once or twice...

They're so high they forget they just smoked like 15 minutes before.

It's like a roofie-circle, but with weed.
no you might be a brain surgeon because determining the difference of 7 millimeters is really difficult to do and requires a lot of talent. 

I wasn't sarcastically mocking you. 

You're very melodramatic.

you can really tell the difference between 7mm when moving over 40cm?
For me my macro gets better my my micro gets worse 
Min here is like 7.25. I'm making 9 and split rent three ways and am still broke as fuck... 
Haha. That's okay!

A nice dark imperial stout before a match often helps steady my hands when I play Widowmaker. So I feel ya, man!
They get anxious about playing competitive, so they smoke pot, then they get anxious because of the pot, ^so ^they ^smoke ^more ^thinking ^it's ^the ^anxiety ^about ^playing ^competitive, ^^so ^^they ^^feel ^^more ^^anxious, ^^^so ^^^they ^^^smoke ^^^more ^^^thinking ^^^it's ^^^the ^^^anxiety ^^^about ^^^playing ^^^competitive, ^^^^so ^^^^they ^^^^feel ^^^^more ^^^^anxious, ^^^^^so ^^^^^they ^^^^^smoke ^^^^^more...
Fine. Your right it was melodramatic, but I'm hangry and having a shitty day. 

I think the human body and brain is a lot more perceptive than you apparently. You haven't really provided more of an argument than saying that I could be a brain surgeon with that level of sensitivity. 

Ok maybe I could be a brain surgeon. Who knows.

The human body can detect very slight differences in temperature. Say +-3c?

Well, based on your logic of difference  divided by absolute temperature, that's slightly more than 1% at around 20c. I don't think your argument is compelling. 
It's the same here, hence the almost double...but yeah. I could be fine if I either sucked it up and found some roommates, or moved to a worse part of town. but I'm already basically in the worst part of town I'm ok with living in.

It just makes me sad to realize that so many jobs want to pay you minimum wage, with no regard for how impossible it is to live at that pay rate. I once overheard the owner of the restaurant franchise I used to work at talking with one of his friends about something, and I heard him say "it would suck, but if you could force yourself to live on 50,000 a year and save the rest, you could...." And it took everything I had not to jump into the conversation I was eavesdropping on and be like "motherfucker, not a single one of your goddamn employees even makes that much! And you're talking about how living off only 50k would suck!" At the time I was making maybe 16k a year and living with 3 roommates so I could afford rent. 

So I feel you. Being broke SUCKS. I'm super grateful I finally have a job that is trying to compensate me fairly. Without it, I wouldn't be living by myself, which is one of the best decisions I've ever made. Living with others really stresses me out, and since getting my own place, I've noticed I'm way calmer and happier. Keep working at it! You'll eventually find something to make your life a little better :)
What's your favorite brew?
The human body can detect very slight differences in temperature. Say +-3c?

+-3c of 20 is not 1%. 

you should check your math. 

3/20 = 15% 

1% is 0.2c, 20/100 = 0.2

its 20c |+-0.2c|

which I would also say is quite difficult to determine the difference of. 
True. I'm worried that living alone would make me depressed. But I'm living with some roommates and sometimes I think depressed would be better.

Overall? That's tough to answer. But, I am a huge fan of Founder's Breakfast Stout. I like coffee/chocolate beer with higher ABV's.

EDIT: Although, the other night I was drinking a couple cans of Yeti Imperial Stout and playing Winston for my own amusement. Helped with the immersion.
He said absolute temperature. 20 degrees Celsius is 293 Kelvin, so 3 degrees Celsius is around 1% of that
Dude. Kelvin. In on my phone so it sucks to type out a bunch of math.

Kelvin is Celsius plus 272.

Absolute temperature refers to kelvin. 
Do you already struggle with depression? As someone who definitely does, I can say that it has helped tremendously for me to live alone. I'm a serious introvert though, it's not uncommon for my friends to not see me for weeks (except on battlenet, but that's different for some reason). So going from never being truly alone to having it available whenever I choose is like a massive security blanket that helps me stay happy.

Plus, my friends are still there, and happy to have me over whenever, should I feel unfit to be alone (which does happen sometimes...some days I just feel like I may do something dumb like swallow a bunch of pills). 

So it's not all bad! It's very liberating. I'd see if you can find a 6 month or even a month to month lease and try it out. Worst case, you go back to living with roommates. Best case, you've discovered a new awesome lifestyle!
As a Widowmaker main, I approve!
hahahaaahahahaha
 
Sorry I didn't expect him to change units to disingenuously prove a point. 

why are you changing units. 

you could use 20K and the a 1% difference between that. 



I'd love to do that. I don't think I could afford it. Also, most place around here seem to be only month to month after you've stayed a year. 

How do we do our jobs + protect our healers from flankers?
I'm an Ana main + flex player in Diamond. I've been noticing more and more that during my matches (as a healer, mainly Ana), there are two issues that come from not having a specific "Help" button, but which can be remedied through paying attention.

*1) Teammates that need healing, and are often completely out of my LOS.*

They don't retreat when they need healing as they "expect" me to be ready to heal them when needed, regardless of how many walls are between me and them. Every healer in OW needs some kind of LOS to heal their teammates. Ana especially. However, this brings up an issue which leads to the second point.

*2) I get flanked, and die way too often to good flankers.*

This can be totally avoided, regardless of the flankers skill, for the most part. As Ana, I try to stick next to at least one other player for protection, most often a tank. However, I'll find that very frequently that since my teammates are way too focused on the enemies, they don't even realize I'm nowhere near them.

So I often end up alone, and due to Ana's meager damage, if I miss my sleep dart, I'm dead. If I land my sleep dart, well I can't even take out a full health Tracer, so I'm probably still dead.

**So this brings me to my question,**

Since there is no "I need help." button for healers, how do the other 4-5 players on the team manage to pay attention to their healer, and protect them when they are being flanked, meanwhile, doing their job of killing the enemy team? (Including situations like, solo-healing and multiple healers). 

*I appreciate any and all answers! :)*

P.S. I understand this has many variables, including the skill and game sense of the healer, the skill and game sense of other said players, and general communication through speech. But, just as I've been in teams where I can't even reach the points because enemy flankers are just waiting for me to walk back alone; I've been on teams where at least one team mate is always at the ready and sticks somewhat close to me to makes sure I stay alive. In the latter situation, I can easily manage to solo heal my teammates as any healer (except maybe Zen/Lucio), depending on the enemy comp/skill). So this is definitely something everyone would benefit from learning to execute without having to ask for it. Including myself.Well, first of all your second support should always be the first one to look after you. If for some reason this doesn't happen or you're solo-healing, call out someone specific to watch your back. The specific part is really important, in many parts of overwatch (and life really). You know the bystander effect? It's real and noticeable. Saying: 'guys, there is a tracer constantly killing me, help me out', will usually result in everyone thinking: 'yeah, someone should help her'. Asking roadhog or mccree or whoever specifically to help is more useful most of the time. Same with asking for a better comp: ask specific players to swap. Just make sure you never sound like you blame them, that just makes people defensive. Just make a friendly request from one person to another, most people are reasonable enough and want to help, if you ask nicely. If not, well, nothing will help.
  

> If I land my sleep dart, well I can't even take out a full health Tracer

On this point specifically, practice the shoot -> nade -> shoot + melee combo. Nade can be thrown between the two primary shots without slowing their rhythm; melee can come immediately after the second shot (you want to practice getting the melee to follow up the shot as soon as possible). You start the combo just as the vic is getting up after sleep wears off naturally, their recovery animation is extended that way which should let you get the whole sequence done.

The above is for 200hp heroes, for tracer you can kill her with just shoot -> nade -> melee which is much faster, all those attacks can be executed immediately after each other without any wait time.
Tracer, Genji, and to a lesser extent, Sombra, will forever be Ana's primary counters. Winston and D.Va are secondary counters. 

If your team doesn't peel for you, running to them for help doesn't work, and asking them via mic to help you fails, then it's pretty much your team's fault for not covering for you. Deathball works great for Ana against a dive comp.

Genji isn't that big of a deal and Sombra isn't common enough to be an issue. The biggest issue is probably when the other team runs a good Tracer. Peeling can still fail if their Tracer is good: any skilled Tracer can just dive straight into you even within a huge crowd, one-clip you, and then escape.

McCree and D.Va are probably the best means of getting cover against Tracer, so stick near them. Lucio, Soldier, Orisa, Winston and Zarya are decent as well. If you don't have any of those heroes on your team, then some other DPS heroes can work too.

Staying near your other healer (either Zen or Mercy) to pocket them for a pocket back in return helps *a bit* with stalling for time. It won't save you entirely, but it can help you out in a pinch if you have no other means left. Lucio is decent too but you won't be able to rely on his slow heal for very long, so plan an escape.
> 1) Teammates that need healing, and are often completely out of my LOS.

Don't sacrifice your positioning to save someone who you have no chance of healing. If they flame you in chat for not healing all game let them know that you need LOS and also need to remain in a safe position. If they are tilting you, mute them right away.

> 2) I get flanked, and die way too often to good flankers.

If the enemy team is running a heavy dive comp or they have a flanker that is giving you trouble, move in closer to your tank line. The enemy flanker is not going to be as willing to dive into the middle of your team for you as they would if you are separated. 

> Since there is no "I need help." button for healers, how do the other 4-5 players on the team manage to pay attention to their healer, and protect them when they are being flanked, meanwhile, doing their job of killing the enemy team? (Including situations like, solo-healing and multiple healers).

This is just game sense. Be aware of what comp the enemy team is running and what they are likely to do. If you haven't seen the Tracer in a while they are likely flanking or setting up a combo with their pulse bomb. It's the tank/DPS job to be aware that the enemy is giving your healers a hard time and it's the support players job to move to a position that enables their team to assist them. 

You will have games where your team is able to deal with flankers easily and you will have games where your team appears to be a pack of race horses with blinders on. Just have to roll with the punches and focus on improving your own play. 
point 1 and 2 are entirely up to your positioning tbh
Good point! 
I should ask this question in both situations. If there are one support, or two supports. 

Excellent advice. That point could also be translated to the beginning of the match. Asking a specific player to look out for you will make that point from the very beginning.

However, how can you do this, for example, in something like quickplay? Or for players who don't necessarily have mics?

And also, from the "protectors" point of view, what should they do?
That is a very good technique. I usually use it, but since it's a little difficult to pull off sometimes since there is a delay for the punch, which means Tracer's usually have enough time to recall away.

Maybe I'm still not great at that yet though. 
In quick play? Forget it. Might as well ask people to help you in FFA deathmatch. You can ask them of course, but don't expect great results.
 
No mic isn't really an issue, some people just don't like talking in game, doesn't mean they're not listening or trying to cooperate. One or two people organizing the team is usually enough. Just ask others to use the agree command or type. 

If the protector gets asked to help the support, they should hang back a bit, do their usual stuff, but stay attentive to the sounds of a flanker attacking the backline. They don't have to babysit necessarily, just be aware if there is a Tracer or something flanking around.    
Pretty sure the second version for tracer (no second shot) should be doable before she can react, as long as you let her wake up herself.
Haha, it's worth a shot. QP is known for uncooperative players, but no one likes to lose. You'll often see QP matches start with 6 DPS, and end with a 2+2+2 comp. 

Ok cool, so if you manage to coordinate a designated "protector" before the match starts, then typing is good enough (no mic necessary, although useful)? 

What heroes do you think would be most effective at this particular role? 
Oh, so letting them wake up on their own takes longer than waking them up with damage?

Oh wow, I didn't realize.. That's great!

Thank you for the video :)

Tips for junkrat and roadhog
I want to main junkrat and roadhog I used to main them but then forgot about them and began to main dva and mercy roadhog and junkrat have changed and I want to know good positions good ways to use ult effectively and other helpful tips thank you in advance.You shouldnt worry that much about Ulting with Roadhog. He builds Ult quick so let it rip.  
Best times :
-Want to push a big crowd that are right in your face
-Hold enemy(ies) against a wall or in a corner (this allows you to keep pumping damage with no pushback
- To negate an enemy Ult or priority enemy (high charge zarya or nano boosted rein)
  Nothing gives me more pleasure than taking that ulting winston and hold him in a corner or straight in the air.  It takes him much longer to build his than yours so its a trade in your favor 
Against a deathball with road you will be able to offensively ult but be careful deathball can easily punish a hog with the hitscans they run.

Hog whatever is available and break shields this takes a while to get down. To defensive and youll get mowed to aggresive and youll feed uncontrollably. They key is to be a bit of both. A presence.

As for dive comp youll normally play midline frontish as TaB will sustain you but dont get to iverzelous if they have a zen. Your hook will be 9 out of 10 times used to counter a initiation on your supports. Monkey dives? Hook him. Gengji ults near you supports? Whole hog. Everyone bum rushes your team? Whole hog.

Your ability to land hooks will decide if they are gonna focus you or not. If your focused this is good. Your team can punish them while you sustain via megas and TaB. Youll be expected to preform teetering sub 300hp. 

Any and all attempts thrown at your healers will require you to peel them. This is critical. If they full dive and you peel supress enough to drag it out they will crumble. Or should.

Also remember tab is very valuable for soldier pharah mccree reaper. Dont spam it if you know a fight is coming and you feel your about to be the focus.

Other then that get good at your hook combo. Always peel winston if he initiates onto healers and try to demech d.va if they are at a standstill to keep momentumn in your favor.
Good advice, but using hog's ult for kills is rather situational.

Many people accuse roadhog of having a useless ult, it's weak for scoring kills but that's not its real purpose - it's really his main zoning tool. People probably overlook this because he was traditionally played as a dps and not really at all as a tank.

Just as zen is a pretty weak healer via his main abilities but makes up for it with a massive team-healing ult, roadhog as a tank has poor main abilities for creating space, but a brilliant ult for this purpose. Throw everyone off the objective with it at key moments. If they're walled in and can't be thrown out, they're simply killed instead.
Yea I totally agree with you, thats why I usually use it to removing a high priority enemy (ulting winstons and genjis or nano boosted players)  the goal isnt to kill them but just disrupt.   We agree here


From console to pc
I'm currently a console genji/tracer player who can flex pick. I'm diamond/master on console and I just recently bought a pc. Any tips on pc overwatch?

I'm new to pc gaming so tips would really help thanks.I was a gold player on ps4 with around 100 hours and just made the switch to pc a few days ago, which I'm mostly a pc gamer so idk why I didnt in the first place. But its definitely more fast paced because everyone can control their hero better. Also unlike console you MUST pay attention for widows, some widows have crazy good aim on pc and will wreck shit. But overall everyone has better aim and after some practice you will too. Now one big thing that surprised me was I placed at like 2230 sr and currently at like 2280. On ps4 I'm at like 1600 in thr current season lol. But I feel like I'm much better with a mouse and keyboard than controller. By the time u get to 25 for comp you'll put in enough qp time to get thr hang of controls and fine tune them to work for you. Also people actually try in competitive and you'll get a good team comp like 9/10 games and many more people use mics, and seem to be less kids playing which is always nice. But you'll like it, overwatch feels much better on pc (plus blizz doesnt give two shits anout console ow) 
Not really. Aim will be the transition you have to make.

From the enemy you need to avoid walking in straight lines. Youll need to strafe a lot and be cautious as good players will land a majority of their shots.

Basically watch out the time to kill is smaller due to better control of their weapon.

Have fun you wont look back.
Some settings that are recommended.

1. When you start playing on PC make sure that you turned of mouse acceleration in the windows settings. 

2. Find a good mouse sensitivity for you. There are so many guides on YouTube.

3. Turn of V-sync in the overwatch settings. (v-sync limits the framerate to 60. Higher input lag.)

I can't give you details about the gameplay side because I'm not sure what are the big differences.

Hope you understand my bad English:D

I'm going to go the physical route and tout the importance of PROPER POSTURE!  You don't want to wreck your wrists, back, and neck for the rest of your life by playing video games sitting in an improper position.  Skyline has a great video going over [proper posture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG_3bS3ftVM) .  Mostly, keep your wrists elevated, do not rest them on the edge of the desk or on one of those gel supports (those can do more damage than good).  Also, make sure your monitor(s) are elevated to a high level so you have to sip upright to look straight at them.  There are some other things, and definitely watch Skyline's video and do some research on proper computer posture.  It can feel a little uncomfortable at first, but your body will thank you years later when you dont have to wear wrist braces 24/7. 
In terms of PC hardware, if you have a 144hz monitor, make sure you're constantly above 144 FPS, make sure V-sync is off as it causes input lagg. 

You also need to enable 144hz in your display settings too if you haven't done that already (Right-click Desktop > Display settings > Display adapter properties > Monitor tab > Set Screen refresh rate to 144 Hertz).

In terms of using a mouse a keyboard, just keep playing the game and you'll get used to the game more and more. You reached diamond/master on console because you're able to keep learning and teaching yourself to get to that level and it'll be the same on PC, except you already have a lot of game sense and just need to develop your mechanics back up again.

Some other stuff which helped me is lower my sensitivity (I use 800 DPI and 4 sens in-game) and have plenty of mouse space too.
Can u tell me how big are the difference in the team comps between PC and console? 
I think a pharah is extremely powerful on console. Is it?
shes super strong on pc as well, shes in a good chunk of the games ive played. Oh McCree is really strong too, at least in higher ranks, mccree was hard on console becaue of aim like widow, but super strong on pci feel like overallthers good team comps, 2 2 2 is pretty common. hanzo is pretty decent too. like widows are able to snipe me while running around as lucio, never had that shit on console. 
I think in low ranks, she's better on pc than console. Low ranked console hitscans have aim assist (or atleast they should for hitscan), and PC players dont have aim assist. This means that the aim assist for console players helps exponentially more compared to the superior MnK aiming. However, if your team has no one good at hitscan, don't make them run hitscan. A bad hitscan is a semi immobile target for a pharah who doesnt have to directly hit all her shots. A decent tracer is still a bit of a problem for the enemy team. 

Why are this season's placements so wonky?
**Context:** My friend doesn't really play this game and he started playing ranked for the first time seriously in S5. He went from gold to plat towards the end of the season. I played sparingly in S5 and went from 2500 to 3000.

**Question:** We both decided to do placements solo. He went 4-8 (2 of them were DC losses) and somehow placed 3061, which is 530 points higher than his season end last year. I went 3-6-1 and placed 2975 which was 51 points lower than my season end last year. How did he manage to hit a higher SR than my season end despite never hitting plat for the first time last season (he was silver-gold in all other seasons and didn't even finish placements in another one)? For me, I've always hovered around high plat (2900+) to low diamond every season since season 2. In my placements, I was playing with high plat to master level players (from last season) and yet, I placed below my season end.There is the visible rank everyone achieves, and then their hidden matchmaking rank (MMR). These usually differ, sometimes in drastic amounts. These used to (and maybe still do) determine your SR gains and losses per game, to some degree, which is why you may have a time where you are always winning more than you're losing, such as if your MMR is grandmasters but you decayed to diamond. As for placements, your hidden MMR used to not affect placements much, as blizzard was basing the placements finish on last season's end SR. However, this time around blizzard from what I can tell has changed it so you place exactly at or at least much closer to where your hidden MMR says you should be.
Your friend is just simply better than you.
Probably he was carrying his teams super hard even when losing...

The game also have an secret MMR that is the base for the new SR  at the start of S6

And, if the game went wrong, his SR will decay a bit by each loss/win (will lose more than win SR peer loss/win) and he will end on his truth place
Posted this on /r/Overwatch : I went 8-2 on my main and got placed at 3160, a little higher than where I finished. On my alt account I went 5-5 and placed at 3650. Almost 600 higher than finish sr and 500 higher than the career high. For some reason it decided to put me in a masters game in the beginning. I won that and maintained a 50% win rate so it placed me there.

edit: the thread with screens [https://www.reddit.com/r/overwatch/comments/6y0r8b](https://www.reddit.com/r/overwatch/comments/6y0r8b)
Won 3/10 last season,placed 1800. They changed placements this season. I won 8/10 this season and placed 1800. I'm not shit, apparently my subconscious mind just likes being silver. Played my ass off too, and felt great winning all those games. Pretty disheartening at the end. But I guess that's good, time to get better.
I'm happy they let me continue where my last season ended. Ended at 2426 and now got placed at 2500. 7 wins, 3 losses. 
I placed almost 700SR higher than S5 ending SR on one of my accounts, and 200SR higher on my other two accounts. 9-1, 9-1, and 4-6 win-loss respectively. Interesting how it worked out. 
finished 3.2k on alt last season, got 4.1k which is 100 sr lower than main, i ain't complaining
Yeah I realize that there is hidden mmr but in qp/arcade, a lot of the times, I'm against diamond to master (sometimes gm) level players which means my minimum mmr is at least diamond level. My friend played mostly qp with very low level friends (1500-2000 visible SR). From queuing with him and speccing him while waiting for him to finish, I know our skill level is pretty big. Hell, he even admits that he doesn't deserve the rank and starts trolling me by calling me plat scrub haha. 
He played mostly support and even told me that he didn't do that much. He played mostly zen/lucio cuz he hates mercy. And given that this game can't quantify how much work you put in through peeling and such, there's no way the game recognized that he carried on lucio as an example.

And even the games that I lost, I played really well. There was one game where I got flat out stomped, but all the rest, I filled and played well on zen and soldier (soldier is my main). 
Just curious, why have three accounts?
p.s. have screens pm if you want em
I'm diamond and the game puts me in silver to diamond qp games, while my plat friend is consistently put in master to top 500 qp games. I can tell you that he is not that much better than me. I wouldn't go on qp mmr to determine someone's skill ever, as qp mmr is completely different from comp mmr.
QP and comp have separate mmr
Well, I don't know what to tell you then. From what I heard from friends and from my personal experience, the change in placements seemed to be because the hidden MMR had a much more drastic effect this time around. As for the QP/arcade thing, the game is a *lot* more lenient about who plays against who. As a mid diamond last season, I wound up in a few games against top 500s, which is absolutely insane because they outplayed us in every way, but it balanced out because they had a few silvers on their team as well.
Friends stopped playing and I inherited them. 
Pretty sure they're downvoting because you typed in 4.1k (Which is actually really unlikely for someone who ended in Diamond and placed this high)  instead of 3.1k
I'm just trying to understand, I'm not frustrated or mad that he got a higher rank, but just confused and want to know how it happened. (it's funny when he trolls me when we queue together saying shut up you plat scrub cuz he knows that I'm better.)

That being said, this isn't an alt account where you are able to play at a high level since the start, but rather it's his first account from launch where he participated in 6 seasons, so this account also encountered his growing pains and him just trying to learn every hero. If it was an alt account, it would totally be understandable to get a high rating, but for him to place silver to gold in 4 seasons and finally to barely make plat last season, it's interesting how the game placed him into diamond this season. 
when i get home i will post screens
If decay is in the picture it can happen
wow there is a reason i said pm for screens, yes it is unlikely, but thats what happened. Check out lordharis, who has never been gm and ended season 3.9k or something and got ranked 4.1k+. 

Zarya target priorities, and what to do about Rein/Orissa shields?
I'm a career low gold player that started taking comp more seriously midway through season 5. Placed 2056 this season. In effort to climb I've decided to main Zarya but my hero pool also includes D.Va, Lucio, and Ana. 

Rough queue session last night: 2-5-2. In one of the wins the other team had a leaver. I feel like I'm playing well but the losses keep piling up. Here's my [overbuff](https://www.overbuff.com/players/pc/Sanctions-11241/heroes/zarya?mode=competitive)

Other than D.Va what targets should I focus? What should I do about a Rein/Orissa shield. At this SR when I push past the shield to do some damage the team usually gets scared and watches me go in solo. Staying with the team is fruitless because I'm just pumping damage into a shield. Any tips?

Finally, are there any Zarya coaches out there that would help me?
you focus whatever is out of position or in reach of a kill/pressuring. you decide this case by case.

you usually dont wanna push past the shield, shooting them with your team is better in most cases(except for tracer, even genji should be shoot shields a lot and tracer should too if theres nothing better to do) because if you walk past shields you are usually too close. you arent winston, you dont really go beyond the border of the enemy team.

>I'm just pumping damage into a shield

doing damage against shield is never useless. especially rein can be killed easily once his barrier is down and he has pressure, then he has to leave the fight and you can shoot others.

vs orisa its a bit different because she has more shields, but that doesent mean you stop shooting shields. it just means that monkey and zen might be a good pick against orisa.

i can give you tips and you can add me on disocrd or ingame if you want. posting vods would be good.
Another nice trick to start learning now is to use right-click when you're dueling as well as just lobbing it into the enemy team when poking

In the 1v1 scenario, the right-click slightly pushes away enemies causing them to lose their aim - the angle they get pushed in can be predicted, learning this on Zarya allow me to 'carry' harder on her because I could win most 1v1's
I would focus targets that are easy to track with your beam. Zen, Mcree, Hanzo, enemy Zarya, monkey, rein and dva
Thanks for asking a good question, Dgrizzle. I'm a diamond Zarya main - [overbuff](https://www.overbuff.com/players/pc/GilGalad-11874/heroes/zarya).

Focusing shields can be fine if the enemy isn't advancing. You don't want to be extending too far beyond your team, as you aren't that kind of tank. Burning down shields makes grav easier as well, which is always a plus.

Focusing large or slow-moving targets is your best bet, or lobbing grenades into squishies grouped up. Melting tanks allows you to build ult quickly, which is often the deciding factor in a push.

Don't try to chase or prioritize Lucio, Pharah, Widow, Hanzo, or Tracer. You could be better utilized against others.

In addition, the other tank on your team is the best bet for a bubble, generally speaking. If you have a diving dps or a healer getting focused, bubble them of course.
4.1k peak zarya main, i wouldn't mind helping you out if you want
Hi dgrizzle, 
I'm a high plat (2.9k) Mei main who plays her as an off tank (similar to Zaryas role) or if forced even as a main tank , so I can maybe help.

1. Breaking Reins shield is never useless. Sure, there are better ways to spend your time but once his shield is down, often he and his team tend to be toast.

2. Orisa is a bit different, since her shield is on such a short cd and even once it's broken she can still effectively hold her ground. Learn to bomb next to and a bit behind it. If Orisa isn't centered in her shield it'll hurt her (not much but better than an everlasting shield fight).

3. You almost never want to push past the enemy shields, except if you have a dive team (Winston) jumping in and you can gain smth from the chaos of your attack (like free charge).

4. If you are good with Lucio (actually only his movement skills), I'd always recommend flanking, dropping from top and booping the tanks out of position to expose the enemy team/tank. Personally I like to drop from top, boop and speedbuff my way back to my team (though I only ever play Lucio in QP so ranked is probably a different story).

5. Orisa counters DVas ult quite nicely but in close combat DVa wins vs Orisa with a little support very clearly. Fly in either bubbled, with an Ana/Mercy healing you, boop the Orisa so maybe the enemy healers' LOS is interrupted and start shooting. Keep DM to pull back.

If you want I can review some VODs. I'm not a Zarya main but she does play very similar to Mei in many aspects and I figure that I can see if you make general mistakes just as good as any other tank/off tank main. :)
[free^ coaching^ hereeeeeee^](discord.gg/wawasbootcamp)
Love having a winston dive in when I play Zarya. Bubble him after he takes a bit of damage so the healers can do their job. Pretty much play around Winston making space. Focus tanks for ult then if youre above 50 charge (for the gun) kill squishies cause that damage is busted. Save personal bubble after your 200 hp takes some damage unless youre getting bursted. More or less about team comp and playing as a single unit. 
In general in Overwatch target priority is to focus someone you can safely kill. Zarya has no mobility abilities so she is typically in the front line killing other tanks since she can't safely dive backline and get out alive like dive heroes can. You will frequently encounter enemy DPS who are out of position (e.g. too far up, not protected by their tanks) and if so you can focus them safely. If there are enemies diving your backline you can of course safely turn around and focus them while peeling for teammates.

As far as interacting with shields, it depends on your team comp: 

If you have a traditional death ball comp (e.g. Solider, McCree, Junkrat) you coordinate with your team and destroy the shield together. The shield should go down in seconds if everyone is participating.

If you have teammates who prefer to avoid the shield altogether (e.g. Genji, Tracer, Doomfist, Pharah, Widowmaker) then you kind of have no choice but to poke past the shield or find some position that lets you avoid the shield. If you ever find that you are DPSing the shield alone or that it takes a long time to disable the shield that's bad and you not being effective.
I'll help you man. You can add me and we can play qp and I can give you advice. Career high 3850 with zarya 
Genji, Dva, Bastion (if you're high charge, bubble and you'll melt him before he can damage you), Torb, Mcree, Road, junk, Mei (once you're almost frozen, bubble and it resets the freeze)

https://discord.gg/Sm3JjC is a very good discord for looking for coaches. 

Make sure you use your bubbles for either other tanks, your healers w little movement (zen, Ana, and mercy if she has no one to fly to but you), or situations when a reaper is ulting, Winston jumps enemy team, etc.

Don't just randomly give it to a soldier when he is behind cover.
If the teams are poking behind shields:

1. Use your self bubble to farm charge

2. Use your team bubble to farm charge

If teams will engage (say that you're full charge and will crush their souls on voice, this will give confidence. Also having an ult to combo)

1. Use your self bubble only to save yourself in last cases or to put yourself in the front of an lethal attack to an ally

2. Use your team bubble to allow your DPS heroes to use their ults without dying (Like genji, soldier, pharah, reaper)

______

If you're tanking and isn't the main shield (If you're Zarya and have an reinhardt for example) or if you're Healing but isn't the main healer (If you're Zenyatta or Lúcio for example and have an Ana or Mercy)

You can do this to shake things up and force an attack:

1. Pick an DPS with high chances of shaking the situation of the game. Like Pharah, Junkrat, DoomFist, and force the changes to happen.

Usually picking an new hero will surprise the enemy and will allow your team to stomp them.

Putting an Pharah / DoomFist when you're on attack will distract the defense a LOT and make then worry about you allowing your team to have space

Putting Junkrat when you're defending can stop an moving payload that seemed to be impossible, since they won't be ready for all that spam and take a ton of damage.


PS. changing from Tank / Healer to DPS in the middle of a Fight can scare the fuck out of your teammates, since they will think you're trowing. Always say on voice what you're going to do. Like "Hey guys, I have an Idea that probably will win this point for us, help me" and pick the hero and go FAST!

If it don't work, of course, go back to your role
Spam the shit out of nades to build ult. Single beam when you are 1v1 at higher than 30 charge. You can nade at 5 ammo for a splash of damage instead of beam. You don't want to push past shields, as other have said. Watch out for Orisa too. She can outduel you with halt, fortify and shields. I'd keep my distance and farm charge with self bubble.

Shoots shields when doing nothing else/build up grav opportunity. 
Always look to take 1v1's where you can punish bad positioning on the enemy's part when you are at 50+ charge.With personal bubble up the only 1v1's you should generally avoid are Bastion and Reaper

For instance kings row has a lot of places where you will regularly find people out of posisiton you can take advantage off. Hotel on first phase attack,mega health room next to the pit 3rd phase attack ect.


The right clicks are great for burst damage too at zero charge they do 45,at max charge its 90.Even when you spot an easy beam kill,using a right click to finish it off is more effecient a lot of the time

Also when you are near a rein rather than burning down his shield its often worth just stepping foward past his barrier and nading his feet.

Your stats are ok,you have very good average energy and decent accuracy,.But seem to be lacking elims and straight up  damage,might be worth going more aggressive :)


I always alt fire shields because it does more damage to it, and if people pop through it they will take more damage.  If someone on your team is amazing, I duo them. Exception Genji this can confuse him and ruin his damage. If you have enough awareness to watch when his deflect runs out, then it's fine. Reaper can become nearly immortal with an extra Zarya bubble duo. 

Healers getting bubbles is helpful as well. Anyone giving them a hard time in the back line should be focused if they are taking out tanks and healers. Don't forget to use your own body to tank damage when you can. You regen quickly
Don't know if anyone has mentioned this yet or not, but when you shoot at shields, always aim as if you're going for max dmg on a target behind the shield--basically, pretend there is no shield and try to get headshots. If the shield breaks or gets dropped while you're firing, you want your shots to be lined up for maximum killing power. Worst case scenario, you're still hitting the shield. Best case, you kill someone while just focusing on breaking the shield. 
https://www.youtube.com/user/jwcanas1an you should check this dude out, he has helped me a bunch with my zarya play and reviews zarya VODs from bronze all the way thru top500
142 Hour (former) Zarya main checking in. Roughly 3,000SR.

Zars still emerging from a bit of a tough spot with alot of dive characters still getting around. My career winrate with Zarya is >55% but running about 40% this season for some reason. She's getting back into meta tho.

Don't be afraid to pump Rein's shield as a last resort but don't waste your time on Orisa's shield. If you're at high charge just pump anyone you can catch. Throw a few bombs into a group of squishies.

RE going in solo, don't. You should be playing off a tank, hug him like a bitch and 'jump-frog' with him. Let him go in, tank some damage, go past him and take some damage yourself. If your buddy tank has any idea, he will jump-frog you again. You get good charge and you make space for your DPS.

You've got some good offers from higher Zaryas to coach but I'm always happy to watch Zarya VODs.
As Zarya, your priorities are, in order:

1. Staying alive
2. Staying alive
3. Keeping your teammates alive
4. Charging your ultimate
5. Maintaining energy, getting picks

When you're poking, you can bubble a tank or two but only because higher charge is better for farming ult and everyone is probably relatively safe. If you're above ~40 charge you should switch to mostly using your personal barrier for charge, and keeping your projected barrier for saving lives. Use shields reactively instead of preemptively.

Then, it's just about landing as much damage as fast as possible to charge Graviton. That means lobbing grenades into crowds and drilling tanks with your beam. Don't even really worry about trying to get picks on the squishies unless they're low/out of position or your team is focusing them because if your beam tracking is inconsistent (like me) you're better off farming charge from a bigger target than doing no damage to Lucio. 

Obvious candidates for Project Barrier are, well, anyone that might otherwise die or take a bunch of damage soon. Anyone ulting, a charging Reinhardt, an out-of-position support. Think about who you would shoot if you were the enemy, then watch to see if that person starts taking damage (again, reactively not preemptively). 

Then, attempt to land the most impactful ult in the game knowing that your team is watching and will definitely know if you fuck it up. No pressure!
Thanks everyone for all the input and offers to help me improve.

After watching some of the linked videos I have found major problems with my bubble usage. I'm way too greedy farming charge and spam out bubbles when I already have really high (>=80) charge. Then I don't have a bubble to protect squishies or other tank when I need it. Also need to be more patient with using my personal bubble, as I tend to pop it as soon as I take any damage rather than waiting for them to eat into my health at all.

There are plenty of other areas to improve in but that one really stood out to me.

Thanks again everyone.
Orisa has one S
> you arent winston, you dont really go beyond the border of the enemy team.

Yeah I'm learning this, and sometimes I do risk it by going beyond the shield but it just depends on the situation. Sometimes its to get off a right click and finish a healer, then bubble and run out. 

Should I be asking my team to help me break the rein shield?
Also always right click on your last 1-10 rounds of ammo. It costs 25 but you can still use it for the full damage below 25 ammo, effectively giving you 124 at most.
Does her right-click benefit from her charge? I was never clear on that.
And Ana! She is slow as shit like zen, but you'll have to burn thru an extra 100hp if she drops her biotic grenade
PM sent
PM sent
Bastion melts you way faster than you can kill him
>Don't just randomly give it to a soldier when he is behind cover.3

Yeah bubble use and charge management was the first mechanic I learned. Always room for improvement but for the most part I don't waste random bubbles.
i think most people are already shooting shields if they have nothing better to attack but a call is n ever a bad idea as it can break shields within seconds
>Should I be asking my team to help me break the rein shield?

Yes, absolutely. Especially if you are close to grav.
100 charge Zarya kills a lot of things quickly.  If I have bubble up, I'm happy to run into Rein or Orisa and kill them.  Rein can keep his shield up, but if you're literally in his face it doesn't block anything.  (I do this a lot with D.va, but find the need to do it as Zarya from time to time.)

Orisa is similarly easy to kill.  She moves slowly while shooting at you.  Very easy to track with the beam.

Don't run into a 1v6, but don't hesitate to take a 1v1 when you have charge and hopefully your personal bubble.
Definitely, I think it can 2 shot squishies at high charge
It's crazy dangerous at max charge.
If you walk up to him w high charge, shoot at him, he then starts shooting you, get to around 200hp, bubble, then he'll be dead, especially if you're moving. 

If he's getting pocketed that's a whole different story, can't help you there.
It also buffs the splash range iirc
Huh, good to know. I always kind of assumed it didn't for some reason.
This opens a world of possibilities! 

I can't believe I just assumed that only the left click was affected by charge. 
Bastion does 500 dps and has 300hp with armor and damage reduction, even at full charge he wins. Your shield is gone in 0.4 seconds and you're dead in another 0.8. Even At 190 dps (full charge) it takes 2 seconds of perfect accuracy to get him down and you're more likely to be sitting at 80% or so. That would have to be a bad bastion
You'll be amazed how easy it can be to snipe squishies running away with it. Full charge Zarya is one of the most deadly characters in the game anywhere beyond sniper-range.
Yeah the best thing to do as Zarya against Bastion is to farm charge off his blindfiring, and then pressure him with your alt fire. Don't try to 1v1.
In gold, you can usually dance on his head and win. You should definitely not try him at greater than melee range, better to just nade him until he moves

How do you map your mouse/Keyboard?
I'm new to playing Overwatch on a mouse and keyboard (been playing on console since S1). I find the default controls work for me on most heroes. Reload seems to be in a kind of awkward spot and I can't tell you how many times I've accidentally ulted pressing Q when trying to press tab. So what are some changes from the default you guys use for all heroes? Also I noticed for some heroes like Mercy and Lucio the default controls are especially awkward. So I'm sure they probably require a lot of changes to feel comfortable. 

Side question: What sensitivity does everybody play on? I think the default is 15. I tried bringing it down to 10, then 7.5. Now that I'm used to 7.5 I think a little lower might help me make my shots a little more precise. 

Any help is appreciated. Btw I'm not asking you guys what I should play or what is best because I don't want to get a bunch of "Just play whatever works for you" responses. I'm curious what works for you guys so I can test it for myself. I was in the same situation as you were, I wasn't comfortable with default map when I switched from ps4 overwatch to pc overwatch, so what I did:

Mouse 4 button for melee (side-lower button on mouse)
Mouse 5 button for reload (side-upper button on mouse)
Mouse scroll down for ultimate 
Q for hello/greetings button
Sensitivity 5 in-game 

With this ult change I managed to stop accidently using ult but press hello instead lol and use the ult efficiently (managed to get the pulse bombs stuck most of the time as a tracer)
It really just comes down to personal preference, 9/10 people are going to have some variance in their settings. In game sens is just a multiplier of your DPI of your mouse. Dpi usually have set around 800-1000. I'm going 800 dpi and 6.00 sens. Works well for me, slow enough where I can aim well and fast enough where I can 180 out and run if I need to, or hit some flick sleep darts with Ana :D. But I have ultimate on one of my mouse buttons as well as melee and voice chat hotkey (Logitech g502 AMAZING mouse btw especially for fps, got it for csgo.) Made Q my comm menu, made zxc quick chat stuff like healing ulti status and group up. I'm coming from 2500 hours in dota 2 so I'm pretty comfortable moving around the keyboard with hot keys.  Since youre less experienced on pc it may take some time but keep tweaking them until you get it right, sensitivity is most important. General rule of thumb is if you move your mouse from left part of mouse pad to the right its a full 180. With pc you generally want lower sens than console counterpart because presise aim is VERY important. Idk console players can aim when theyre sens is maxed out for whatever reason, call of duty mentality I guess. 
I have reload on side mouse buttom 3 and second ability next to it on buttom 4. Melee on E and crouch on caps lock (gonna try to change crouch on space, instead of jump). Also I made some specific hero changes

Zenyatta: discord on right click, alt fire on side mouse buttom 4

Lucio: jump on right click

Tracer: blink on space

I've heard Ana can be a bit easier to play if you change scope and sleep dart, but I didn't - got used to play the way I do it.
The only thing from my settings that I would recommend to others is to bind ultimate to mouse3 (mouse-wheel press), hard to press on accident but very reachable. 

Aside from that, I've bound all the buttons that I need while aiming to the keyboard rather than the mouse, since I play with high sens and pressing buttons messes my aim. So for example attack is on shift, secondary attack on spacebar, while on the mouse I only have melee, reload and a few chat binds. Not sure if you wanna follow me on this though.
Anything you have to aim to use put on mouse, any auto placed stuff like soldier healbot is fine on shift/e.

When it comes to symm turrets or discord orb there's a lot of different thoughts. With the mercy rework I'm changing my key mapping a lot. Most of this comes down to playstyle and what mouse you have.
I really like those changes. What's your caps lock? 
Oh and my sens is 6, 1500, but it's a really personal thing. Test it and you'll get your perfect one. There're youtube videos on how to test it wisely. 

Also you might want to have higher sens for, let's say, D.va and lower for McCree. So it depends on what hero are you going to play. I guess some people have diff senses for diff heroes, but I personally don't overthink about it. 
I have Zen discord and harmony on mouse wheel up and down. So easy. 
Push to talk button since it's easier to access than default button

[NA PC] Mercy Tutoring from a Masters Mercy
I've only ever tutored one person and we both feel it greatly helped her improve. Having so much fun before, I'd like to 'freely' tutor one person to really feel out the ropes with helping others grow.

&nbsp;

I reached 3509 (Masters) last season and have been playing since closed beta, I also played Medic in Team Fortress 2 for 8 years, and make videos. I don't know if that makes me qualified; however, the last person I tutored said she learned a lot.

&nbsp;

Here's how I tutor: 
While both of us are in a Discord channel, I'll spectate you for a match or two to ascertain your level of skill. Afterwards we'll go over it, then I'll continue to spectate and begin coaching you. Eventually I'll play a match, you'll be able to see the coaching advice employed first hand. With your permission, I can stream it so that once the stream is finished, you can go back and rewatch the stream highlight to review.

&nbsp;

Truthfully, I was a little nervous making this post. I am interested in finding someone to apprentice; however, don't want to come off as being arrogant, patronizing or condescending. I feel we all have room to grow and I'd like to share some of my experience with others if they're interested.

Having troubles against Symmetra + Torbjorn
* Introduction
This is a cry for help from a high gold player, i'm at 2400 Sr and I think that I can get to plat but some comps are really troubling.
Every time that my team plays well on 2cp or hybrid maps on defense (They arent able to do anything to us) and we go on attack about 80% of the time the enemy team goes Sym+Torb+Rein/Orisa+Mercy and it just makes it impossible to push. 
* Rushing them
Organizing a push is already complicated enough with players that dont care about anything but sometimes you can organize a rush but when you do rush them, before they have 150+ armor and shield on everyone, you get fried up by sentries and when you take them out you are already being hit by a torb turret and 6 enemies so the enemy already picked off 1-2 players and because symmetra's ult charges faster than a coked up tracer the picks that my team gets are almost irrelevant because they will come back in 5-10 seconds and if most people die in their team and their teleporter was killed mercy can just ressurect them, it becomes extremely frustating because it seems that any hero is countered by something.
* Heroes I tried using
Tracer and genji: I thought they would be decent against it because they will be able to flank and pick off their supports and destroy their teleport. But with the extra hp is harder to kill the enemy and because you're taking longer their team can get to you, and when I try to destroy their teli sym gets a warning and my genji-tracer v1's with symmetras don't end up well
Winston: the same reason as genji but because he has a lower damage output it's also really hard to kill supports and he takes a while to destroy the teli and a 350 Hp symmetra can almost kill a winston if she plays her cards right but the issue is that winston has a hard time against torbjorn and rein.
Sombra: I thought she would be pretty good against it but it's really hard to pull off hacks and get kills with a lot of turrets but her EMP is the best thing i found so far against it.
Does anyone have any tips?I'm getting really frustrated since it's such a common compJunkrat, pharah, and hanzo(maybe Mei too the ult seems good).  Are imo the best DPS heroes in these situations. I don't play projectile DPS personally but I'll typically recommend these switches to other players. Outside of the projectile heroes I like Reaper because they don't have mobility to run away from him. 

Dive tanks(monkey+Dva) are also pretty good. The catch is that monkey is good vs sym but bad vs torb because of the armor so you want to try to win point on first push. Dva can eat sym balls to deny ult to help slow down their build up as well. 

EMP combined with a variety of DPS ults can do wonders here too. Sombra can also pull double duty hunting down Sym ults. 

Support wise they don't necessarily add a whole awful lot but I prefer Zenyatta/Ana. Because typically they run a very tight defense and you don't want your Mercy being all up in their face. And Zen just because killing them faster is good and they don't have a lot of options for sending heroes after them when they're outside of range. 
Don't play Genji into Symm.  At your level it's pure feed.
My go-to recommendation when people are having trouble with builders is Pharah. Being able to poke from a distance + splash damage makes it easy to get rid of turrets, both Sym's and Torb's. She's versatile enough to be played as a dive hero if you so desire, and she has sinergies with a lot of other heroes. Also, if you have a Mercy pocketing you and some decent positioning, you're gonna kick some serious ass.
Junkrat can work, lob nades and dodge in and out of cover to avoid damage, or PharaMercy to take out a turret or shield gen if it's visible to the sky. With heals Phara can always take out turret 


I dropped from 2800 to 2400 because of these kinds of high damage comps though, I really hate it. I almost always win koth though since that cancer isn't so good, as well as most pure payload maps. 
You have to try and get your team to push early and heavily commit,at the start of the round is when these comps are at the weakest,by the 3rd fight they have usually snowballed  and are extremely hard to break,but worse than that it tends to have tilted your team by that point.


Obviously you wont know for certain that they run this comp till the first team fight,so if you do lose it you need to get your team to quickly regroup and and go in hard the second time around.

Its hard to recommend a comp to counter it tbh,as your sorta at the mercy of what heros your teammates can play well.

Dva/winston seems to be a pretty solid tank duo to break it if they both dive into together and just hope your dps see you commit and follow up
My advice to you would be to pick heroes that produce trash damage (not that they are trash), heroes like Junkrat, Phara, Winston to destroy the turrets;  Even running an offensive Symmetra works as her beam can fry the turrets very quickly and her orbs go through Reinhardt's and Orisa's shields.  Snipers excel here because if a Widow or Hanzo pick her off before a push its usually game over for the defensive team.  Symm's turrets only have 1 HP each, so they are very easy to kill; the issue with Sym is that she thrives on chaos of the battlefield and teams not working cohesively together; if she has a pocket Mercy you'd best try your darnedest to make sure that she's dead before the teamfight.  DO. NOT. PEEL. FOR. HER. TP/SM.  I cannot emphasise this enough; too many times teams will split up on point to go and find the teleporter to kill it; then we're picked off one by one and lose the point.  I'm not sure many people understand that often times a Symmetra will inadvertently stagger her own team by placing a TP.

Like others have said, running a Tracer/Genji can be feeding the enemy team simply because its too much damage to deal with.  A Sombra is actually ideal in this situation as if you're stealthy enough you can destroy turrets at a distance, can hack the Torbjorn turret if its focusing on the team, and her ult disables all turrets for 10 seconds.
Winston's bubble is actually one of the best ways to quickly deal with the turret.
I'm not playing genji to kill sym, i did it to kill her teleporter  
Maybe you should listen to the answer you asked a question about. Why even post in the first place if you know better anyway. Stop thinking you know everything and try to learn. 
Doesn't matter what you're targeting... her turrets and - if, as is likely, she's lurking - primary fire make the heal support he already needs unreasonably high.  Any half-decent Symm will deny your entrances and force you to take too much undeflectable poke to contribute.

Tracer and Sombra are better choices all around unless you or your tanks are super good.
They also said that the enemy had a Torb, which is one of the hard counters to Tracer.

Junkrat and Pharah are better counters to these characters, especially Junkrat.
most of 2cp maps have great flanks for genji and tracer to go behind

Climbing out of gold
Did anyone climb out of gold in season 5? Or now in season 6? 

I consistently get games where somebody throws. It's been about every other game. Nobody seems to be able to play more than one hero and people get pissed and petty when you ask them to switch. 

This is hell guys. How are you supposed to climb in a game that is so focused on team play. 

So much weighs on your whole team cooperating and for me if HT now it seems impossible to climb. I would say just concentrate on yourself. Had a game yesterday where we had on defence 3 dps (with a Hanzo) Sym, Zen and Rein. We stomp the other team pretty hard.

Game before that had 3 dps, 1 tank and 2 heals. First round they rolled us almost to the end but we held. Second round we rolled them faster and won after like 2 minutes.

You just have to accept people will play what they want and most of the time it will work because they're playing their comfort picks. Sure it's a team game but think about it like life - no one owes you anything so don't expect them to play with you. Don't rely on anyone but yourself
Honestly you really can't play comp games these days with a serious attitude. You just can't. You'll go insane. You have to force yourself to adopt a 'fuck it if we win great if we don't whatever, i'm gonna play to have fun.' Just look at any Overwatch streamer. Not a single one thinks comp is actually good right now, and most don't really take matches seriously.

That does **not** mean you start playing whatever the fuck you want and pick torb when your team already has 3 dps. It means you still pick relative to your team, but just stop caring about what others have picked - to the extent that it won't drastically affect the team in a very fucking obvious way. So if there's 5 dps, sure it might be worth saying something vague (beyond that isn't worth it imo, again blame Blizzard for being indecisive on how they want to run this game) but you have 2 tanks, 2 healer, a torb and junkrat, just let it go.

Also I would advise you to really get to know how to play something consistent. So not Torb, or Junkrat (well maybe he is in this broken state), or Symmetra, or Widow...Yeah they can work beautifully but too many things have to align for that to be the case and as you've realized, teamwork isn't really common these days. Back when I climbed to Plat, I learned Ana and Rein, because those two formed (and still form to an extent) the backbone of a good, reliable comp. People fail to realize these days that even though dive is the meta, more often than not they would be better off just running a standard rein comp. Just because you see winston + zarya/dva being run in the tournaments doesn't mean all of a sudden you're going to be a godly dive winston. You're not Miro. If you are comfortable with Rein, stick with Rein, especially at these ranks where a dive comp doesn't automatically mean a rein is useless, and having that shield and free earthshatters actually still means something.
In season 5 I was ranked at 2100, dropped at 1900 at the beginning of the season and finished the season at 2600 (season high 2700). This season I did 9-1 in placements so I was ranked directly in plat.

So you can definitely go out of gold even if your "true rank"is not that high (I believe mine is around 2600).
I play mostly healers and tanks (ana, zen, winston, dva and zarya). However if you can play them decently I think zen and winston are beasts in gold.

You will get a lot of retarded teams, and i advise you that maybe one third of the time (when you get stupid teamcomp) just mute everything and play whatever you want. It will help you not getting desperate by the stupidity of dps autolocks. 
I dropped steadily through season 5.  A third of my season five games had a leaver in them on my team.  So far in season six it's only happened once out of a dozen or so games.  Time will tell.
Problem is in some games you have idiots, but even in the games that you have a chance in, you are tilted and don't play at a level deserving of a higher rank.


You gotta be playing well in all your games, so you can be the difference maker in enough of them to rank up.


Take a break and come back and you'll do better.


And you can always post your gameplay so people can point out how to improve and make a bigger difference in games.
Play zen, drop balls on enemies faces. Win. Source: 70% winrate with him in gold this season and slowly climbing
I sometimes use "prefer this player" functionality in console. Not sure if it really helps. But I do notice that I get to play with the same guys I preferred at times. 

I climbed to platinum the last season. And still at low plat this season. I used zen a lot. Because you can kill and heal. Doesn't need to rely on teammates as much as other heroes. He can also debuff. There are even times I get 4 golds with zen which is a bad sign for your team because your dps aren't killing enough. But it shows that you can handle your own with your team. 

Then mostly a lot of luck with good teammates. Hahahaha. And hope you don't get toxic players and leavers. 
My alt account placed mid gold in S5 and I climbed to 2800 in about a week. Just play what you're best at, 95% of games in this rank are won by the team who has better mechanical skill and positioning, team comp doesn't matter half as much as a lot of people think. There will always be days where you drop due to throwers, leavers and things like that but you can't control those things so just chill and call it a day if you lose too much in a row.

Of course you will have an easier time if you're competent on heroes with high carry potential. On my climb to 2800 I played almost exclusively Tracer (my main) and then dropped a few hundred points because I started playing heroes I don't have as much experience on.
> Did anyone climb out of gold in season 5? Or now in season 6?

Quite a lot of people yes

> I consistently get games where somebody throws. It's been about every other game. Nobody seems to be able to play more than one hero and people get pissed and petty when you ask them to switch.

I have 1 account in high gold and the other in low plat. I'd rather play with gold than plat because of the ragers.

> This is hell guys. How are you supposed to climb in a game that is so focused on team play.

You are not supposed to climb. You will only climb when you get better. If you stay in the same range for 3 seasons, that means you are right where you need to be.

> So much weighs on your whole team cooperating and for me if HT now it seems impossible to climb.

Then you are at the correct ranking for your actual skill.
I climbed out of gold on PC in season 5 it was my first season and honestly I don't believe Elo hell at all I rarely run into leavers/ throwers I climbed out with my main Genji and flexing onto other dps most tanks and Lucio 

Edit: I mainly played Genji though
If you want to get out of gold stop thinking in every game there is a thrower or troll cause this is not the case. Someone who doens't jump himself over a cliff or is just afk all game is not a thrower. Change you attitude and it will be easy to get out of gold. You just have to realize that it is YOU being bad. Even dia's are still "bad". So stop looking at your teammates and improve on your mistake. I am sure thousands of people made it out of gold this season. My friend included. 
If you are at a pretty high level, open an alt account. The match making system will match you with players that are more cooperative and eager to win. Much less trolls and throwers. This has been my experience and I climbed out of my rank at main account really fast in my alt. 


I dunno if you knew this but you can group up with players to avoid playing with Torb mains. =)

Seriously OP: find people to play with! check the Reddit LFG, guilded.gg., discords, find a clan or whatever. THIS is vital for your mental health.

the alternative, like some said allready, is to stop caring. simple as that.
So is there just no hope for those with a low rank? We're stuck here and are never getting out? 
Called the placebo effect. I'm pretty sure blizzard commented on this in the past. 
Thing is the hours I can really play don't match up with most people so I end up solo Qing my games a lot of the time
As a torb main this season I feel offended. In gold it really doesn't matter what you pick just play your character well. I climbed out of gold recently playing torb exclusively
Many people that tried this came to the same conclusion.  The communication difference and cooperation I've experienced cannot be explained by the placebo effect.  There is a more of a willingness to win.  I believe I'm getting matched up with relatively low level players on my alt account.

I think blizzard tries to match teams up according to there average level in addition to SR and perhaps career high.  As a player with a silver border I'm more likely to see one on the other team.  If not, the opposing team players might have a higher level on average compared to the rest of my team to "balance levels".

 
then why not add the "gud guys" you meet in comp? Playing SoloQ will grind you down if you don´t stop to care...
I didn't consider that factor, that new players might try to win more often than 400+ level players who have been around the same SR for some time
It's too late mate

Low SR gains in season 6
Has anybody experienced low SR gains this season?

I am currently sitting on a 63.6% winrate this season with about 25 played games and I gain about 20 SR each win and lose roughly 25 SR.

I know about the hidden MMR but this season seems strange to me because in season 5 this ratio was 25-30 SR per win and i lost about 25 SR per loss.

I am currently 100 SR below my last season high and i have no clue why i get punished like this.My best bet is because we don't get placed lower than our hidden MMRs this season, we are not getting the higher SR (different from the boosted after placement matches SR) that we would normally get from being lower than where the system expects us to be (hidden MMR). 

For example, I am usually mid diamond which makes me believe my hidden MMR is around 2700 and before this season, I usually get placed gold (2416 I placed season 5). I would usually get around 30-40 SR per win and lose 15-20 up until I hit mid plat (around 2800) then my SR per win dropped to 15-25 and my SR per loss stayed around 15-20. This season, I placed at 2780 (after boosted matches I was at around 3000) and my SR gains range about 10-20 and my losses are 20-25.

Some people say this kind of biased system doesn't exist, but every season the evidence becomes more and more clear.
mercy player perhaps? sombra? any off meta hero?
Looks like the nerfed perfomance SR gains kicked in bois!
> punished

Seriously, just stop saying that about a game.
The most likely explanation is that since they didn't artificially drop our SR after completing placements that they had no reason to give out of placement bonus SR so we could climb back up.

In past seasons they would take whatever your actual placement was, subtract some given amount (anecdotal evidence suggests anywhere from 100-300 SR on average), then give you upwards of 50 games after placements to earn bonus SR to get you where you "belong." Since they're not subtracting that SR from where we place then there's no reason to provide the bonus gains out of placements to help us climb.

The original idea of subtracting SR was because this is a ladder system and they wanted us to experience the climb. To *feel* like we're making progress but I think they realized this was just a placebo that many players knew better about and preferred not to have. Thus the placements we have this season.

Edit: Just to clarify, to my knowledge Blizzard hasn't officially stated that they removed out of placement bonuses. I only suspect as much based on anecdotal evidence provided by my own experience, my friends, and posts like OP's that are noticing as much.
>My best bet is because we don't get placed lower than our hidden MMRs this season, we are not getting the higher SR (different from the boosted after placement matches SR) that we would normally get from being lower than where the system expects us to be (hidden MMR).

I think this may be close but I'd be willing to bet it's the out of placement bonus more than anything. I believe they removed the boosted matches out of placements. Since they placed us where we "belong" then there's no need to have the bonuses after placements to help us get to our intended rank.

Your past experiences indicate getting placed 200-300 SR lower than your intended rank, having boosted SR to get you to your intended rank, the out of placement bonuses being used up resulting in what seems to be lowered SR gains or leveled off gains/losses. From there you just rise and fall like normal. If you were climbing from mid plat to mid diamond then your MMR *should* come with you **if** you've managed to hold that rank for any length of time.

MMR confidence gets stronger the more matches you play in a rank and maintain that rank. If you're rising and falling by any considerable amount then MMR confidence may be a bit less confident and likely holds somewhere in the middle, your average.  If you just peak at mid diamond but don't sit there consistently then your MMR probably won't rise to that level. It suspects that it's possibly just a fluke that you reached that high or that possibly you were carried a little bit. 

**Keep in mind this is largely educated guessing based on official information Blizzard has provided.** I'm not trying to suggest this is exactly how it works but I do feel pretty strongly that it works this way or close to it based on the pieces put together from official statements from Blizzard. 
nope. Dva, Winston, Zen, Ana and Soldier mostly
I believe my hidden MMR is lower because in season 3 (when I was in between jobs for about a month) I was able to climb (grind) from mid gold (2350) to mid diamond (3250) and then stayed at mid diamond for the last month (season high was 3312, end of season was 3226). Season 4 I placed around the same (2350) and slowly made my way to diamond over the three months, barely hit it (3010) and then stopped playing, so season high and end of season was 3010. Season 5 I didn't play until the last two weeks and placed around the same (2380) and climbed until I reached 2860 which is where I was at the end of the season.  This season I got placed at 2780 and haven't played after placements. 

So I'm not peaking at mid diamond and then falling, I've been able to stay there consistently when I've been able to play enough games to get there. I'm not a big fan of how much I have to grind to get to where I belong (mid diamond), which is why I complain about being placed in mid-gold, but I don't really complain about being placed in plat because I understand why I am there.  

What I hate is doing 10 placement matches every season when the system already knows where it wants to place me.
With the exception of S3, it sounds like you peaked in diamond then quit playing or didn't play much. Another official confirmation from Blizzard is that MMR gains confidence with the more games you play. The implication here is that if you don't play many games it will lose confidence. I think there are multiple ways this could interpreted but what it can mean is in situations like peaking in diamond and not playing for the rest of the season or getting there in the last month and hoovering there for a few weeks could depend on how many games you played in that time. If you didn't play very mean then MMR could have been fuzzy on whether or not you actually belonged there.

Keep in mind also, during S3-4 win/lose streaks could also accidentally boost people to places they don't belong (up or down). Now, I'm not suggesting this did or didn't happen to you. I don't know your experience. What I'm trying to get across is the fact that there are many, many variables, most of which we don't know of or how they work, so there is a very likely reasonable explanation to describe your situation. It just may not be a simple one.

While it hasn't been confirmed, it's entirely possible that streaks could have shaken confidence in MMR which would contribute to the explanation of why and how so many people were fluctuating up and down because of streaks. Not just because of being able to get on a streak and get lucky enough to boost your SR up or down but having MMR be less confident would allow someone to rise up and down with there SR more too. If MMR were more solidified then the streaks wouldn't have effected SR as badly. Alternatively, if MMR was keeping streaks in check (to some degree) then if it's confidence were lessened then streaks could have been much, much worse. It's all theoretical anyway. We'll never really know unless Blizzard clears the air.

Again, I'm not trying to belittle your experience or deny your skill or potential. I'm not suggesting you don't belong in diamond. I'm simply saying that there are a lot of factors. Consider the different possibilities before jumping to any conclusion that the system is rigged or biased. It very well may not be but due to circumstances that we can't explain, your situation may be completely legit.

Best way to practice Pharah air battles?
whats the best way to practice mid air shots with Pharah? either against other Pharahs or their Mercys or even Doomfist now.

P.S. When going up against a pharmercy, should I focus Mercy or Pharah?>P.S. When going up against a pharmercy, should I focus Mercy or Pharah?

Mercy. Better option IMO is to just ignore them altogether at the beginning of the fight. Unless the other Pharamercy combo is consistently killing you as Pharah (which is rare) or you know you can consistently kill them (which is just as rare), you are better off killing everyone on the ground first.
Can't give any tips for how to practice, but here's the target priority:

If you're alone against a Pharmercy and nobody else who can reliably shoot them is in range, you want to shoot the Mercy, because she will heal any hits on the Pharah back within 2 seconds, meaning you would need 3^* hits in a row without any additional aim time, at which point you might as well just get into a pro team if you can do that consistently. Mercy needs 6 seconds to heal back with an additional second to start up her self-regen, so one hit every 6-7 seconds is progress against Mercy, compared to within 1-2 seconds against Pharah(with the rocket fire rate being 0.91). You can kill a Mercy if you can hit her within 3 seconds of the first hit, and with 3 rockets you can take a total of 9-10 seconds counting from the first one to kill the Mercy(again, compared to the 2 seconds against Pharah). AFTER all that you just need to beat the Pharah in a duel.

However if others are shooting the Pharah as well, I'd go for the Pharah, since if Pharah dies, Mercy has no way to keep in the air and everyone else can shoot her afterwards as well. Depends on how important it is to get rid of Mercy in the given situation is though. If she's THE priority target, the above strategy can still be used, you just have others shoot the Mercy as well.

^*: Note that it is theoretically possible to kill Pharah in 2 hits while she's being healed by Mercy if her fast movement(Space or E) causes the 2 rockets to connect within 0.66 seconds as opposed to 0.91 seconds.

Talespin demonstrated air battles in the Practice Range.
If you find a good pharah in a game, add them and ask to 1v1 sometimes. They'll probably appreciate the help too!
I just ignore their pharah and focus people on the ground. Depending on the level you're playing at most players can't reliably pharah vs pharah. If they have pharmercy targeting you and you're helping your team take out ground targets then the ground fight essentially becomes a 6v4 in your teams favour
Check out YourOverwatch channel on YouTube. They just put out a video exactly on this. 
custom bot game and set a pharah (you) and 5 mercy's vs 6 pharahs with reduced damage. 5 mercy will keep you and each other alive while you can take shots at any of the pharahs while slowly killing them.
also if you focus the mercy and end up eliminating her, she will have to respawn and get back so during that period of time they will be down a healer/without their healer (i mean i don't know if any mercy players would focus on being pharmercy if they are solo healing but you know)
This is really good info to know! Thank you!
I saw that, It's what prompted this post as i didn't feel it was complete enough of a guide to actually make one good at airshots, It was just theory.
There are no pharah bots

For those who play Torbjorn in competitive, what is the best advice you can give?
I like to mix things up a bit and picking up torb in a competitive setting. Any positioning tips, turret placement tips, etc will greatly be appreciated!1) Never play torb on offense. Ever. 

2) Drop turrets and armor for yourself while under duress.  You take priority for armor, then healers, then flankers, then reg dps. Lvl 1 turrets take 1-3 seconds for enemies to destroy. The distance created and distraction will save you more than you think. 

3) Build Ult through long distance spam at chokes often as possible and rip molten core to zone when down in team fights.

4) Pair with shields. 

5) Get the golden gun and spam "trust me" followed by " hear me baby". Your teammates will respect it.

6) Dance emote when your MC turret shreds

7) google best torb turret locations 

8) profit




Peakd at 4050 playing only torb on my smurf attack, defence, KOTH.

1. Crossfire with your turret, like hanamura point A defence i usually put the turret in the stairs it will shot through the window while im spamming into the choke from the other side, while using corners to show the least amount of my body.

2. When DV.a uses defence matrix its time to pull out the hammer.

3. Make a turret near the enemy spawn for ultcharge at the start of the game.

4. When trying to get a level 2 up (or 3 when ulting) i will sometimes stand in front of the turret and face it while feeding myself armor so the turret wont take any dmg just to get it up. (Most all good torbs do this).

5. Use your gun, don' overcommit to your turret and switch up your turret location every once in a while to confuse the enemy.
Place your turrets where you feel it'd be awkward for the enemies to get to.

Throw down armour packs whenever you can. If everyone already has armour then throw spare ones onto the point where people can grab them easily.

Throw down a level 1 turret if you have to duel someone and a level 2 is not already set up.

When facing a hog, drop your turret in front of yourself. It might block his hook.

"!" over your turret means it's firing. If it's constantly firing then consider molten core. 
dont babysit the turret
Torb is my boy, my little golden battle demon.  Basically, if you do well with him already just ignore any whining and do your thing.  
It's your game that you bought with your money, play it how you like. 
As for strats, I rarely am anywhere near my turret, and am almost always sniping or firing towards enemies at head height.  I also enjoy charging into the enemy team spamming "Just start hammering" while swinging a golden tire iron, so take it how you will.  It's my game, and that shit entertains me. 
Torb is a little magma fueled badass, just go nuts. 
When I play torb my favorite thing to do is to walk into spawn and press H so I can play literally anything else
Torb on attack is amazing if the other teams dps are all flankers. Genji/Tracer as defense dps? Torb is going to wreck. 
Last night I played Dorado with no Support and Torb on attack... we crushed the other team. Was a great match actually. (I was Tracer btw)
All great tips. This guy hit a couple points I wanted to cover, so I'll piggyback off them-

Crossfire is important. Especially during molten core. Tanks that have strong shields can only do so in one direction. If you're making Rein decide which side to shield, he is more likely to make a mistake, and allowing your team an early pick. 

Always spawn turret. I've gotten over 30% from teams that are clueless with spawn turrets. That's an early molten core to suppress enemy ults and pushes. People will argue it ruins the element of surprise, fuck em. We don't need surprise, we're all Swedens now. -76 prolly 

I like to move my turret every team fight. Generally there's plenty of downtime to relocate, and that placement can throw off their next push. A trick for turret placement is to be cautious of enemy sight lines to safely destroy it. Make soldier/hanzo/widow expose themselves to try and destroy the turret. 

In very few instances should you be hammering your turret during a push. You can do a lot of damage without your turret, your turret is just your plus one. Never build a level 2 turret in the middle of a team fight. Drop a level 1 and use your gun. Get really good at primary fire headshots. 

Learn how to armor juggle during fights. Throw armor packs into healers when possible so the tanks don't take them. 




Asking for help on how to improve and you provide nothing. Please try to be considerate to people who play characters you don't like.

To op

From a player watching good torbs- turrets should be helping fight when it gets rough not turret v 6 then team comes and helps.
Prioritize squishes/ high impact characters first for armor. 
Molten core is great for zoning or killing
You have a huge crit box- be cautious
Long range snipe spam or shotgun that tank in the face, suprising damage

Have fun and play to improve (: sadly not everyone will support your pick but hey we can't help everyone in this world
Agree with everything u said, there is also a really good torb only named fuey500 on twitch watching how he plays at GM/top 500 is a good thing to learn.
Yep, fuey is great to watch. Him and chro are always fun together. 

Do I play better when I'm tired?
Hello,

Lately I've been noticing while playing McCree late at night, my aim drastically improves. I'm not usually too good, but not to humblebrag, people comment on my aim on McCree when I play at night. 

I'm a high school student, and have lived under the rules of wonderful but strict parents all my life. I'm not used to staying up late, so I can't say this phenomenon has been going on for a while.

My questions for you are: Is my theory legitimate? Does my aim really improve at night when I'm sleepy, or am I completely making that up and believing it? If my theory is true, why does this happen? Does this happen to anyone else?

Thank youIt sounds like when you are awake you overthink your aim. When you're tired, you're just shooting without thinking about hitting headshots, therefore hitting more shots. 

When I play hanzo/McCree high, I hit way more shots. My positioning isn't as reactive as when I'm sober, but my aim is better 
The player base changes too.

I usually start playing after I get home from work and eat. About 7pm EST. In quickplay I am usually playing with players with the same ranking as me, or higher (5 stars and up).

Around 10pm EST, I start seeing fewer and fewer silvers/golds and more 1 to 3 stars, even occasionally the no stars. Which means I am playing against players that are out of position, don't know exactly how to counter an attack or are playing characters outside of their comfort zone.

It happened tonight. I was playing Lucio and was taking on a DVa earlier, and she knew how to get me to leave her alone. Skating circles around her and punching her resulted in her smacking me in the head and me exiting the area.

2 hours later and a DVa won't pay attention to me, thinking I can't do enough damage to take her out of her mech. I just kept shooting, booping and punching and by the time she realized what was going on, her mech was down.

So you may or may not get better as you get tired, but the player base definitely changes as it gets later.
you want the real answer not these bullshit ones. your brain focuses better on what you are doing because you are tired and can't focus on other things. Google it it's true. also an anecdotal experience,  I played until 12pm the next day because I kept winning all night. it felt like I had super Ritalin focus. I went from 3200 to 3800 in one night. that was a while ago, but yea Google it, because I learned about it that night/morning .   
That makes complete sense. Thank you so much for your reply!
That makes a lot of sense. I have for the past few days been playing FFA custom games with the same group of friends, so my opponents don't change much at all. I appreciate the insight though!

I appreciate your comment, my friends have been saying the same thing: that all my brain is focusing on is the screen when I'm tired. But don't put down other people who are trying to be friendly, I don't think their comments were bullshit at all.

So after about a week of season 6 what are your thoughts on the hero changes and impact on the meta and current state of the meta?
I feel like aside from junk being in almost every game the comps are similar to before. See a bit more Orisa who I feel is best tank in the game right now. Still have the standard genji/tracer picks(which I fucking hate as a support main). Never see any 3 tank comps, and only have 2 healers when I'm lucky. Widow seems much more viable now with the cool down decreases. Hook buff makes her a lot more mobile and able to rotate more to keep the enemies on their toes. I really liked the roadhog buff to add moving to take a breather, doesnt make him as much as a walking ult charger as before. 

I feel like overall the defense side of payload maps got buffed quite a bit, with Orisa shield buff, junk buffs ( I know most people play him attack but his ability to spam down chokes and damage shields is SUPER strong and also is able to escape attacking pharahs easier) same with widow since youre able to spam more poison traps and move around points easier and safer. 

I know that a lot of people arent happy with the meta right now, but personally I feel its due to the massive amount of people that play the game right now and many players complete unwillingness to player tank/support. Thats my only real gripe right now and I play support 95% of the time, playing Orisa or dva if by some miracle we have 2 healers before I pick. Personally I feel like we need like 2 more supports and maybe another tank to add more variety to those roles. The ana nerfs hurt her, and unless you play A LOT of ana youre probably not playing her in comp because she can be difficult, especially with genji and tracer running around all day. That leaves mercy lucio and Zen, Zen isn't enough heals to be a solo healer in most cases, lucio lacks quick burst heals and cant sustain his team under heavy burst like Ana. And mercy, is well boring old mercy, she just feels unrewarding to play, definitely excited to see what the finished product of her changes will be. 


Anywho... What's all your thoughts on the changes and the meta?I don't get why people have a problem with roadhog, he doesn't die 
Love it. Climbed 470 sr playing mainly pharah and junkrat, the two most skillful characters. But srsly junkrat a mine needs less damage because I am seeing a lot of tilt because of it and he is a little too dominant at lower ranks like plat where I am
I will say that Orisa is a lot weaker at higher levels where fights tend to occur off of the payload/point more frequently. Her lack of mobility is a large issue, while it's hard to break through her, she gets run down rather easily
I mean he is a tank
He does with orb of discord and a few headshots ;). But hog was amazing when you had the one shot combo, I feel like lately people have been trying to figure out a good way to play him thats not about flanking and one shottingg. His new changes make him more of an actual up front tank, which after the one shot nerf until was near impossible. But now hes able to be up front and take damage and heal and take even more damage with the damage reduction. But my main problem is hes a walking out charge, he doesn't actually block damage like other tanks he just soaks it up and heals himself. I think he pairs well with a shield tank like Orisa where he can hook them behind the shield and the team can fuck them up. He just requires more team play now I think, has to group with him his team to get kills
I really like 2 mines and most people do, it adds mobility and lets him reach places he couldnt before, but the damage is rather high.  He can burst any non tank down almost immediately, you get caught in his trap youre 100% dead, one of his nades and a mine and instadeath. Just lower mine damage by like 20 so he cant Insta blow up people or something. Junk was non existant before so its the classic case of trying to buff a non meta hero into the meta but in turn over doing it and becomes op. But idk junk doesnt bother me as much as other heroes, I hate the super mobile dpsers that always end up in the backlines shitting on me while I play Zen or ana. Only support decent against him is lucio because you can at least boop him to create some semblece of space. 
im kinda learning that as im working my way through upper gold, she doesnt really fare well vs the dive comp, genji tracer and reaper mosttly, i aslo have a lot of trouble with pharah (but who doesnt amirite) she flys over my barrier and fucks me up.  my favorite map to play her is hanamura tho, shes super good at guarding the chokes with her shield.  There are some games where il only die like once or twice and i get like 25+ elims, but also been having games lately where im switching out afterf a few mins because i literally die as soon as i get to the point, im working on figuring out when i can use her tho because she just feels super strong in the right situation

You're absolutely correct!
She's very strong on illios well and Nepal sanctum! And that's not to say she sucks always because if you use her well you can keep climbing, she's just not as versatile as the other tanks currently

[Meta] I made a logo for this subreddit

I like it, the current one is pretty ugly.
MODS PLS
I like this.
To the top with you my man, this needs to become the new logo.
Nice work even though I much prefer the current one. It's kinda clunky but the graduation cap icon says "university" and "learning Reddit" without needing text.
looking good
I really like the third one in your more variations picture. Really reminds me of an actual university crest. Very nicely done!
What I don't like about it is that is has text in it. The moment a logo has to use text to say what it wants to say it kind of failed to serve its purpose in my opinion. 

An interesting somewhat relate discussion is [this ted talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnv5iKB2hl4) about flags. Which I advise anyone to listen to.
Could you make one for the official subreddit as well? Their current one is atrocious
I love it.
I like it but the In action needs some larger lettering and/or the logo smaller. As it is now the Logo overpowers the words...but I do like it a lot. 
This is great! I hope it gets changed to this. 
It looks nice, but it doesn’t work at all at small sizes. The current one works at all sizes.
So my stickers will be outdated? I demand new ones!

JK, this new design looks pretty good.
That looks real nice!
I'd like to see this sub's banner use the logo that has a graduation cap on the OW logo.

OP's design is certainly better than the current banner, but I still think it's too busy. It feels like clutter of cocentric circles + too much detail from having 4 icons on outer rim + text that is hard to read at a glance.
I actually really like the "university graduation cap" and how it fits into the OW logo.  I thought that was a neat concept.
Looks really good.
Looks great! Imo the support/tank/defence/attack logos are a bit unnecessary but still looks wayy better than the current one.
Yaa its clearly just photosshoped

Requesting Overwatch Competitive Feedback for Analysis
Hey. I'm gathering data from the community about how the general views on certain aspects of competitive are. I'm not collecting any personal data, and would be sharing the results on this subreddit. Depending on the amount of data I receive, I plan on doing some analysis, and would like to use it as I study and practice data science. Your responses are appreciated. Link to form : https://goo.gl/forms/FwHaVtDaoB0gwCEG3


The form requires a sign in that prevents multiple entries from the same user. No personal data is being recorded. Thanks for participating!

&nbsp;

**[Update :]**  Woah there! 365 submissions. That's certainly more than I expected! The data has been really interesting to look at. I'm closing the survey now. A summary of the results should be visible for anyone who wants to look at it. I would be looking at the data more closely and would be posting more detailed results. Thank you everyone who participated, and the mods who allowed the survey!Option 17 is my favorite hero
>Which of these picks do you find to be the equivalent of throwing?

maybe add a 'none of the above' option

>Report anyone who throws on the enemy team if told to

maybe add 'report anyone who throws'
"Report non abusive attacks such as "Swap, You're Useless"
Sorry, how is that "non abusive"? I completed poll but there were other dubiously worded questions such as this one.
I'd be interested to see what games people are comparing Overwatch to in terms of toxicity. Played some Dota 2 this past weekend... Overwatch is a big happy family compared to that playerbase.
This is a good idea. I hope we get to see a result for players across various elo's. 
Choosing a 25 slice pie chart to display data of what our mains are probably wasn't the best idea. Otherwise, good survey.
Is there a repository of past OU surveys? Results were interesting. Thank you!
This is a great survey, very detailed. I learned something about myself and why I can't get out of gold every other season and silver this season.

I think I play way to many heros and arn't any good with any one specific hero.

In saying that, down in silver for some reason this season (all though I'm about to climb out today with a few more wins) I went 63 elims with Junkrat which isn't even my main and we still lost. It's definitely a team game and no one person can ever carry, I beleive IDDQD proved this when he went 80 something elims in a match but his other team mates wouldn't switch off to try and counter (there's a youtube vid somewhere with him playing mcree doing this). 

My point is, your whole team has to work together to counter, most of the time one tricking and never changing/adapting regardless how good you are with any specific hero just keeps you locked in the elo hell everyone mentions. 

I could be wrong, feel free to correct me.

Great survey all the same, thanks for putting in the time and effort, we can all learn something here.
Shh.. nobody saw anything.
Those are checkboxes so any answer is optional, you can select none of them and proceed to the next question. Thanks your your feedback.
I don't think that falls in the "Abusive Chat" category literally if no vulgar word had been used, but still is a verbal attack directed towards someone. These are grey areas where opinions might differ, and if so that would be indicated by the results. What else did you find dubious? Thanks for your feedback.
i play league and i wouldn't blame the playerbase but rather just the way mobas are designed. moba games bring out the worst in people. the games are much longer and individual performance is much more apparent.

intentionally feeding the enemy kills will 99% of the time make the game unwinnable for your team. it's arguably worse than afking since feeding the enemy team will make them ridiculous strong.

overwatch doesn't compare in this regard because the worst you can really do to sabotage a game is feed the enemy ult charge or pick a bad hero in order to try throw the game. a 5v6 feels infinitely more winnable than a 4v5 game in league.
Perhaps that deserves a thread of its own
Honestly I've been met with the same if not worse toxicity in upper diamond. If I see another 3 people all lock in dps without saying a word then die and blame the other dps then have a 3 person cluster fuck of intentionally throwing I might just quit playing cause I've lost 300 sr since placing and 9/10 times it's for this reason.
The view responses page of a form is standardized. 
But this soultion doesnt work, cause the question about "Which of these picks do you find to be the equivalent of throwing" I dont belive anyone of them are throwing, yet you stats, doesnt reflect that as i didnt tick a box. Instead it gives wrong info. Cause alot of ppl dont think you can throw by picking a certain hero. Yet you stats doesnt show this. It just says 173 answer this question instead of the 250 ish who actually did.
Hope you understand. :) Cause they way it is now, it wont give correct results. 
I skipped them but didnt know if I could or if the test would force me to go back and fill them. It's not clear that you can in fact skip them so I imagine at least some people will answer even if they don't agree with any option.
so telling someone they are "useless" is not abuse. ok. As far as criticism of the poll - take this question: "Which of these picks do you find to be the equivalent of throwing?". 40% so far saying that "off healer as solo healer". Based on your wording of the question, how will you interpret that data? That 40% think the off healer is throwing for not picking mercy, or that 40% think the team is throwing for not picking a second healer?
I used to play a ton of League. I don't know if it's gotten worse, it wasn't terrible when I played. The stuff I was seeing on Dota 2 was worse than anything I've ever seen. Even complementing my teammates and the like was responded to with slurs and insults... from my other teammates!
I can get the exact figures from the excel sheet after the survey is closed, but right now you're correct. It seems to ignore unselected values. I had not taken this into account earlier. Thanks for informing.
Thanks for informing, I'll make it clear.
I would say this is another grey area where context matters, and as you rightly pointed out this is something I missed out while creating the survey. While writing the question, I considered just the situation if it gave a much lesser chance of winning or not. How one reaches the situation should've been explored further in another question. At the moment I decided only to take into account answering "Is our team throwing" rather than "who on our team is throwing" for that particular question. The survey is still open and accepting inputs, Once it is closed I would be posting results, trying to answer similar questions as yours. Your criticism has been taken into account and would be helpful while looking at similar things. 
I mean there are plenty of situations where someone on your team is actually useless. Telling them straight up isn't the most eloquent way of letting them know but it still seems like more of a legitimate frustration than straight up flaming. 
It's not abuse if it is factually correct. It's just a statement of fact.
The term 'useless' is subjective by definition because you're judging some function or utility in your own content and by your terms. I would say that it's definitely potentially abusive to call someone useless, and if it's potentially abusive, then it should be labeled as abusive.

"I don't think you're helping the team much because we're not able to ____(fill in the blank i.e. capitalize on your hero's abilities)____."

Is that so much harder to say?
Are you kidding? The term "useless" is not subjective by definition. Can it be? I suppose it CAN be, but it is not subjective "by definition" at all. If that player is performing no useful function, are objectively useless. The fact that you are trying to argue with that is mind boggling. 

The fact that "you would say it's definitely potentially abusive" is subjective. THAT is what subjective means. Your interpretation of it is different than mine, but both are neither correct nor incorrect. 

In the case of a useless item (or person), they can be objectively useless and calling them such is not abusive. It may be rude. It may hurt someones feelings. But just because it may do those things does not make it abusive.

By YOUR definition, then, getting a vaccination is abusive, because it hurts that person. Scolding a dog for shitting on the floor is abusive, because it hurts the dogs feelings (and they don't understand). Telling a child NO, you can't have more dessert is abusive because it hurts the childs feelings.

That is patently ludicrous. 

Personally, if I'm being useless, I'd want to know about it. Now, the person who is making that assessment may be incorrect, and then it might fall under your definition of abusive, but THAT is subjective.

Calling someone useless who is useless is not abusive.

I guess we're of different opinions :-)

But some practical advice: it'll probably help you and your teammates for the better if you worded your frustrations differently.

Great tip for solo q players to win more games.
Don't solo q.

Try and find at least 1 buddy around your rank with who you can have a good time while also winning.

And dont find a buddy that is a dps main unless he can flex because you will just get the same old all dps games.

Find someone who is willing to flex so that the two of you can make sure that at least 33% of the team is doing whatever they can to win.

And try to synergize with each other. (Rein-Ana, Pharah-Mercy etc)This is kind of the anti-tip for solo queue. It also sounds very biased and not at all constructive for those who do prefer solo queue.

While I'm not a fan of solo queue either and prefer at minimum to duo (3-4 being my optimal preference), I still respect the solo queuer and their preference to play in solo queue. Some people find it easier/better to play solo than to group up in the first place.
Great tip for skaters to never get any injuries!

Don't skate.
Real advice if you want it.

Play your best hero that has SOME type of control over a outcome if things dont look well. I like hog even post nerf TaB buff.

If im down one but positioned well i have a few critical moments after said pick to make a play.

The key here is to absolutly ONLY focus on what you need to do to win if its to close to have a carry potential.

This means findind ONE win condition and playing to achieve it.
I've actually had the best luck soloqueing. Maybe I just get better faster than my duo partners but I end up getting held back unless I'm playing with my master friend. I've gone from 800to 3250 solo queue.
Nah I got this weird curse for every time I queue with someone in comp I lose every match not even joking I've play around 30 games with different people and we lost everytime
"Great tip for solo Q"

"don't do it"

nice
I've only played a few months and the solo q life just isn't fun anymore.  I can't find my way out of silver and a few good games in a row are followed by an entire night of toxicity.  


So basically your solo queue advice is don't solo queue?
I think without the "stay as a team?" option after matches, I'd give up on OW entirely. I love finding a random group, talking and cooperating together and then just playing with them for a few matches and see how we do.

Doesn't happen all the time but if you're polite and sound like you're a good teammate, you'll get some nice people in return - as opposed to mic silence anyway.

I dont have friends who play this game nor have I ever enjoyed being forced to play with a buddy all the time. I game on my terms and meeting new people is fun!
Bad idea. Most players belong at their rank. If you duo with them, they'll most likely be an anchor. 
Personally I think soloq is way easier than grouping. Grouping is a hit or a miss and you have longer q times 
Personally I think soloq is way easier than grouping. Grouping is a hit or a miss and you have longer q times 
find out what the most imminent threat is and swap heroes/work to fix it - assuming you can play heroes that can right the ship, anyway.
What hero are you playing when solo queueing?
Everyone usually picks DPS and if I'm lucky 1 tank.
So I play Lucio or Zen.  

If we have a good comp, we usually win or at least it's fun and competitive.  
I used to main McCree and was pretty good at him, the problem was I just couldn't carry. I started playing Ana, still hitscan, does decent DPS and sleep dart is amazing for controlling characters that no one else can/will handle. Tracer, Genji etc. Ana is kind of a jack of all trades, she can dish decent damage, stop enemies in their tracks and keep them from healing WHILE healing her own team. I managed to climb into plat playing her so far (solo), looking to hit diamond this season with her as well. Not sure if you are a DPS kind of person but she is kind of the perfect balance to both and she has awesome survivability.

New Hog, New me-need help with aiming/securing kills
So I had about 35 hours on Hog before they nerfed him, and hadn't really touched him until last patch when they buffed his self heal. I really like how he feels with the heal and how hard he can tank ults/quickly charge his-my big issues if securing kills and tracking with his gun when the hook is on CD. How can I be more effective at putting out damage and securing kills/what is the best way to help the team with new Hog aside from body blocking and hooking?Your best bet to secure kills better is by hooking your targets towards your team (i.e dont flank!) and having a better follow-up (second LMB or melee) if you didn't one shot your target. It sounds to me that you're just not hitting your shots, so make sure you're hitting those right-clicks to deal damage from a far and left-clicks for those follow-ups. 

Also I would try working on flick-shots as some people find that method easier than tracking at close ranges.
Land a shot, then hook. Also with hog's buff, you can actually play him as a tank, brawling on the front lines and soaking up a lot of damage. Your overwatch JUST made a video that answers your questions perfectly I think. Lemme grab the link.
I've found the hook combo has become a two-piece skill shot as opposed to a one-piece skill shot. Before, there was a skill shot with the hook projectile in order to secure a kill. Now you have to land a *meaty* right click–maximum damage body shot or partial crit–before landing the hook. The cap for pulling off solo kills as Hog has increased.

His team utility now is not so much a solo kill hero as much as he is a sweeper. Play midline, peel for supports, and use right click to finish off low HP targets. He has to play extremely defensive now because he cannot output viable offensive pressure.
Lots of good comments already, heresy two cents:

I play new hog similar to how you'd play doomfist; you want to push upon front of main tanks just barely, get a hook, push back behind shield, repeat. 

I find that I have more success running hog as a dps rather than second tank, generally I want 2 tanks plus hog. Hog is great with a friendly Orisa, her halt plus your hook makes for easy kills; let her halt then hook as they're running away so that Orisa can help cleanup as they're being pulled in. 

Against shield heavy comps his entry role is the same as it was before; win the shield war by unloading on enemy barriers then hook the tank in the second they're down. Play hog as a tank buster early and cleanup late. 

Hog is great against doomfist, so make life hell for doomfist whenever possible. 
I think that most players are no longer using the shot-melee combo after landing a hook, and are instead opting for a second shot, as the rate of fire has increased.  

Another common strategy right now is using the hook to interrupt D.Va using DM and getting her close to your team to be surrounded and demeched.

I love being that friendly Orisa. 


If there are two- three teammates behind me, I will walk right into a Rein to get him to charge me. I survive it, heal, let the team work on him, or if he decides to do the smart thing and throw a flame at me I will hook him. 

Orisa is irritating, but you can heal through her gun at close range. I go through her shield and force her back. Aggressive Orisa is dangerous so he's decent at countering them with some help from a Pharah or Junkrat. The thing is he definitely needs help. He can't take the enemy apart by himself anymore. 
Yeah this is why I think he combos nicely with low mobility tanks; being the enemy to you. 

What can I learn from sites/apps like Overbuff & Oversumo?
I have the oversumo app and I sometimes check Overbuff (https://www.overbuff.com/players/psn/trentbakersfield?mode=competitive) but I really do not know what to take from those.  

Which stats should I focus on?  Any advice?  you can learn how to obsess over stats. As shaq once said "The day I stopped looking at stats is the day I started winning." 

Oversumo and Overbuff don't really show you where you should improve. All it shows you is that you are improving. 

Ex:If I die a lot, my avg damage goes down. But I have to figure out from that low stat what is causing it. It could be my positioning, it could be that I need to shoot more, etc. 

You should focus more on improving game play and use it as a tool to see how you've improved, not for finding what you should improve at.
Well first off, stats are only a good indicator with enough trials. Games take about 20 minutes, and there are 16 maps in comp. So in order to play all of them once, you need to play about five hours and 20 minutes. In statistics there is a rule that says you need 30 samples to reach your true statistical mean. In other word, you would need to play at least 160 hours on a single character to get a good sample. This doesn't take into account all the various characters you play with. So your sample size will never be big enough, and by the time you get it, you've probably changed your style of play. Bottom line is that the only useful statistic is your accuracy, and even that can be manipulated by shooting shields.

Don't chase statistics. Instead simply compare yourself to a pro that runs your same character, then compare your statistics. I realized that I stood on the payload way too much as soldier when I saw that Surefour hardly ever stands on payload. Then watch vod reviews of yourself and vod reviews of pros. Try to guess what the pros will do (pause the video and make a guess). When you review your vod, try to think about what you could have been doing. It'll be pretty eye opening.
Any rating you get for a particular hero (ex. Master with S76) doesn't mean you necessarily belong in a Master SR. It's best to interpret it as: "you play S76 far better than others at your SR".

As you climb in SR (say you get to Platinum SR), in theory your Oversumo rating for S76 will decrease because now you're facing tougher competition. That's assuming your skill level with S76 remains the same, of course.

Understanding that ratings on Oversumo are relative - it's a good tool to know which areas to focus on to improve.
Good to compare to others if new. "Oh I average 5k dmg as Soldier and most others have 15k. Maybe im not playing him correctly." I have comparatively good stats for my rank on zen but winrate was not great. Over the course of the season I got his win % to 61. the stats were generally the same except for average deaths, those went down from 9 to 6.5, then I noticed a slow trend of my overall healing and trans healing went up. Less deaths, more orb uptime and maybe an extra ult per game. 

Making those connections don't require stats, but I find it has a longer lasting impact on how I approach the game. 
Dont use oversumo or overbuff.
Oversumo is my favorite. All of its stats are performance **per life**. So what should you focus on? Of course you could focus on all the stats at once, but that could be overwhelming for anyone. I'd say the most important and easiest thing to focus on is to **die less**. How? Through better positioning and not being caught without your team.

TL;DR Good positioning reduces deaths -> improves every stat!
Honestly nothing. Oversumo is neat but pretty much useless in practicality. You're better off working on having a good attitude and analyzing what you did good/bad in the match.
My Oversumo says I'm a masters mei but I'm heavily meining her and I'm in high plat so I'm going to say it doesn't tell you shit.  
I'm a joke of a basketball player and I make free throws more consistently than Shaq. Good sentiment, but I think a better comparison would be the age old 

"Numbers don't lie."

They definitely don't tell the whole story with overwatch or any sport for that matter, but there's definitely merit in looking at them at least once. 
More accurately "you have better stats." There's countless ways to stat farm in poor ways that don't help your team win. 
> TL;DR Good positioning reduces deaths -> improves every stat!

So while lowering bad deaths is a good thing, you need to take the deaths stat with a grain of salt. Avoiding deaths at all costs may cause you to play too passively at times and/or make poor decisions.

If your team goes in as 6 and you all get wiped, but you manage to bait out 1 or 2 ults, those are probably good deaths. You trade some clock/point percentage for a large advantage in the next fight. If you didn't push into the fight enough though because you wanted to minimise deaths and retreated early, it's possible the enemy wouldn't have extended as many ults. You lived yes, but it wasn't necessarily good for the team.

The deaths you want to reduce are the meaningless ones. Getting poked to death or dying out of position, but having as few as deaths as possible is not inherently a good thing.
Yes, on Overbuff it looks like I die a lot (I do).  But on Oversumo, my stats for my top 3 guys are usually platinum or master.  Which confuses me.
> performance per life

Not anymore.
dying less is the most important part of fps success.
You being able to make some free throws doesn't mean or take a way anything from Shaqs quote. Also I doubt you could if it wasn't in a game. Players are way better at shooting without the fatigue and pressure of the stage and lights. 

Stats can tell you some things. But most people tend to get obsessed with stats like accuracy and KD ratio without any context. Especially in a game
Like overwatch where it's night and day from one game to the next. 
Sort of. What would be the point of farming stats in the first place, at the expense of actually winning? Almost nobody goes around bragging about their stats on Oversumo.
Anyone that's asking for this sort of advice doesn't need to worry about that much detail. In my tier [mid-high plat], teams don't go in as 6. In the rare case they do, they almost always win. The situations you're talking about seem high diamond and above.

The asker will learn enough through experience to learn when and when not to die. And if you live, it's always good for the team. I mean actually escape and live, not get picked 5 seconds after the rest of your team trying to run away. Staggering is the worst way to die.
Here's the trap with sites like these.

They can only look at the raw numbers. Say you're in mid-silver, and you get put together against 6 five year olds, who just mash on the keyboard. You'll have a higher *everything* than the best progamer recorded in those raw stats, but that doesn't mean that you should be in GM. The solution of this paradox lies in the fact, that clearly if we took your mid-silver skills to a GM match, you would basically have 0 in everything, and all your stats would simply show bottom bronze.

**These kind of apps aren't good for determining *where you should be*, but they can give a picture of a given hero you play.**

Some months ago my friend(he doesn't play comp because he doesn't like it, but last time I saw he was put together with Master-GMs in QP) showed me Oversumo, and we looked through some heroes. I was playing Roadhog at the time(when he could still punish people for bad positioning), so I was interested in looking him up. What I saw was a horribly low accuracy, and a somewhat high kill rate and an insane hook accuracy. I already knew what this meant, since I consciously tried to train him that way, but in this case it showed that my practice was paying off. Basically what I did back then, I rather waited a bit(2-3 sec max) and didn't really do anything, but made sure the hook hits, and made sure the shot afterwards is lined up for the instantkill. Other than that I just used the gun for chip damage in large fights even from a distance when there were no healers around, or shot down shields when needed. Doing all this got me a more consistent kill rate than my teammates at the time, so I saw that the hook consistency I built over time was useful, but the stats also showed the holes I left in my skill with him.

Oversumo and the like are good for getting indepth analysis and self-reflection you gain on a hero when you consider the seen stats and your experience with the given hero. To anyone else those stats are worthless, but to you, they can confirm whether your sub-skills with a given hero really improved as you think, or you just thought so in the middle of the chaos. Also shows clear weaknesses.
Focus on getting every stat for the hero to the same tier you want to be at. If you have a stat at platinum ii vs iv, focus on the ii. Once the minimum of the stats is where you want to be, you should be able to climb pretty steadily in duo queue.
Oversumo compares how you do compared to your tier, not where u would rank...it doesnt mean u are master, it means u are better than your enemies stat wise

Overbuff is a better representation of the full spectrum

If u die a lot, learn to die less...its that simple
Because it's taking into account players across all classes. So a Mercy will have far fewer kills and damage done than a Reaper.
I mostly meant unintentional. "I have great healing therefore I must be good" won't help if you're just healing your roadhog meanwhile your soldier and genji are dying to an enemy pharah. 

That's probably a silver tier example, but all of the minor choices as a healer add up. Maybe you choose to produce the highest healing output in a given moment as opposed to healing the crucial targets. 

Need advice on picking a new main, because the incoming changes to D.Va have been a pretty big turn-off.
I'd like to preface this by saying that I'm looking to climb in competitive.  I recently broke into platinum and would like to keep this upward trend moving!  Since I've climbed the most when focusing on a few heroes, I'd like to keep my number of champs to around three.  So far that's been Zenyatta, Genji, and D.Va; but just from what I've experienced in the PTR, D.Va is not only no longer viable as a real tank, she's just not as fun to play.  So while I recognize my lineup could really benefit from a tank, the only other tank I enjoy is Orisa who can't contribute as much on offense.  Deep down in my heart, my third pick would be Tracer, but I'm reluctant to focus on two flankers.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks!Id learn a hitscan as well as tracer. I'd also suggest learning another tank or two, as well as another healer. I think if you truly want to be able to climb in comp you should be comfortable with at least 2 of each role type.
I'd encourage you to still play D.va as I think she'll be fine after the ptr patch, but if you are looking for a tank to replace D.va I'd recommend Zarya as it'll teach you plenty of new skills and your team will love you since you'll be setting up huge plays.
Any particular reason you don't enjoy rein & zarya? Both get to play more aggressively than orisa. If you can share what it is that you don't like about them, it'll probably help us give a better answer to your question.
I think she's just a buffed version now. Sure she has less matrix up time, but it's up more often now. You have more opportunities to stop burst damage. You just meed to be a little more careful of when you use it. 
I dont see why everyone is bent out of shape because of matrix change. Usually by the time you have it on for a few secs noone is shooting at you anymore, rarely do you use the full charge at once. The way I see it shes better now because it charges faster. The enemy will think matrix is down and you charge in and block their shit pop back out and do your regular d va thing. But in reality the ptr can only do so much, have to see a week or so after shes in comp games to see thr effect it has. And plus shes getting a whole new ability, and can shoot was using boosters, 2 definite buffs in my eyes. 
Roadhog nerfs 2.0 but this time it makes sense and is balanced.
Can second this 100%. Or at least 2-2-1
I couldn't agree more, and I'd like to think I am comfortable with at least 2 from each category, but I'd like to focus on three "mains" and then have my "comfortable with" characters to switch to if the comp needs it.
>Id learn a hitscan as well as tracer. 


Tracer IS a hitscan :p


Minor pet peeve: everyone says hitscan when what they *really* mean is long-range dps.

**edit**

*Of course* I know that people *think* they know what they mean when they say "hitscan." But it's a stupid turn-of-phrase, and they're wrong. Mei icicles and hanzo arrows, for example, work FINE at mid-long range, even for killing Pharah. Half of the hitscan cast does NOT work fine at mid-long range, so using hitscan to mean "long-range" DPS is actually just dumb. If you mean long-range, then say long-range. It's honestly not that hard.
I have a problem landing Zarya's lob's, and I also have a problem landing Rein's pins.  Rein is definitely more satisfying to play, but constantly missing those pins can really get me down.  I  try not to do it until it's necessary, and I love his voice lines.  I just feel stuck behind a shield that team-mates rarely capitalize on.

Why downvote if he is right?
Just to be clear, this post isn't a D.Va debate.  I love D.Va's style and can appreciate that she may still be viable.  I just don't find her that fun any more because they've reduced her damage mitigation and increased her "in your face" style of gameplay. She's essentially a brawler who's escape mechanism is to run in the backline once she pops and hope you get mech back before someone dives you.  
They mean long range hitscan dps but that's not really how language works. If everyone knows what you mean then that's what it is.
You're right, but typically hitscan in this game means "hitscan without dramatic fall-off".  D.Va is "hit-scan" but it doesn't mean much until she's in melee range.
Zarya lobs & rein pins can simply be practiced tbh. If you've managed to learn genji up to plat level, you can learn these things.

I hear you on people not making use of rein's shield though, that's very difficult to work around. Part of what I like about orisa is that you can directly plonk a shield in front of people to force them to get value out of it, no matter how oblivious they are. Similar to dva's matrix in that respect, as you'll no doubt be well aware of. Zarya also provides reactive blocking that doesn't necessarily require teammates to actively follow up on to add value.

Everything seems to be pointing towards zarya:

* is a 'tank' tank, can create space effectively
* not as defence-skewed as orisa
* not reliant on team coordination to provide protection and generally do work (grav works best with coordination of course, but it's not hard for teammates to capitalise on it reactively at a bare minimum, i.e. 'kill the grav'd things')
Because he is not right at all!! You had matrix for 4 seconds. To have it up for 4 seconds you have to use it for 2 seconds recharge for 8 seconds and the you can use it again for 2 seconds. This is way worse then before you need 12 seconds for 4 seconds matrix uptime. You couldve blocked for 4 seconds and in 2 more seconds then now you have it back at full again. Damage won't make up for this. You can't block longer ults and you will either have to ear a ult or protect a teammate every 8 seconds. Way worse then before. 
Theyre making her more of an aggressive damage dealer than damage mitigator is all. I feel like overall the style will be the same. But I like playing diva as like a mid range Winston. Jump in fuck some people up block some damage, boost out get healed repeat. 
I do not identify "hitscan" as "long range" and I'm sure others do too. I don't think I want language to work that way and rather people use words correctly instead. 
Is Zen hitscan?
I'm gonna have to think on this, thanks for... "weighing in".... ^Get ^it? ^^Get ^^it?
You're not wrong, she's just not a tank anymore.
You're not wrong, but 90% of the time you hear someone ask,"Can we get a hitscan?" in team chat, they're saying it because Pharrah needs to be countered; not because Tracer and Reaper are in the cool club.
It doesn't really matter what you want dude it's just what is. What is correct English anyway? You wouldn't even understand people that spoke English 200 years ago. Language evolves.
No. Zen's balls are projectiles 
That would be correct.
Of course language evolves, but people keep that as an excuse and not once they give me a similar example. I remain unconvinced that words getting a completely different meaning counts as language evolving so much as people just misusing them. 

Well that's my opinion anyway, I don't expect anyone to agree with it and this isn't the place to be discussing this so I'll just stop here while I can :)
Yes, I know that.

But Zen works great at dealing long range damage.


Zen can do great damage long range, but it's not reliable because of projectile speed.  I can discord Pharrah, but if she's juking in the air at all, it's a 50/50 chance at best for my orbs hit her until she's closer to the ground.  Most of Zen's long range damage is dealt when he can right click into a group.


Mouse sensitivity and aiming
I've always had a problem maintaining a steady and consistent aim so I looked up what mouse sensitivity most pro players use and to my surprise, a lot of pros seem to have really low sensitivity according to this chart: http://on-winning.com/overwatch-pro-sensitivity-settings-setups-monitor-mouse-keyboard-headset/

Have I just been completely out of the loop? I use 22 mouse sensitivity. Would it be worthwhile to get used to lower sensitivity?Do you have trouble aiming with your 22 mouse sensitivity? What heroes do you primarily play? 

A good starting spot is 800 DPI and 5 sensitivity. Then adjust from there. If it's too slow, then go higher. If it's too high, then go lower. You want to swipe your mouse across your mousepad and be able to do a 360 spin. Again, it's all preference.
get a large mouse pad (something with a length like the qck heavy). I agree 800 5 is a good starting point but since your used to high sens I'd go for 800 6 or 7 and try to get used to that. It is not beneficial to be able to do a lot more than a 180 from center of pad to edge of pad because you never really need to do much more than a 180. So you gain almost nothing and lose stability by being able to do a 360 or more from center of pad to edge.

&nbsp;

It is helpful to be able to do a little more than a 180 from center of pad to edge so that you have some room to aim left after the 180 before you re-center mouse.
22 mouse sensitivity doesn't mean anything until we know your mouse dpi/cpi setting.  Average pro player is about 800dpi and 5 in-game sens.  Some are a bit more, some a bit less.
Yes it really does help with consistent aim. You'll need a bigger mouse pad though....
use [iostux's guide](https://youtu.be/GRFWLJazYYo) for calibrating your sensitivity.

few things to note:

low sensitivity = easier to aim especially for hit scan like MC, widow, 76, ana, zen who needs accuracy

high sensitivity = good for tracking and vision, useful for characters like winston, zarya, rein, symmetra, doomfist, mercy who are more concerned about flicking your screen every where, doing 180 turns and doesn't require any aim.
Yep yep yep. I've settled on 1600dpi 2.75 sens which is 5.5 sens at 800, you'll work out your arm more than at 22 but the precision is worth it. 

Do you know your dpi? 
I wasn't too sure on my DPI since I had to enable a setting to actually change it (I think it was at max by default, so 1800). I put it down to 800 and I'm playing at around 9-11.5 sensitivity in-game and I've noticed a really big difference in my accuracy!
Mine is 800 dpi 4.86 sens
After a month or two of that I'd recommend moving down again, I think you'll find the sweet spot is somewhere between 5 and 7
